<p>However little known the feelings or views of such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span> may be on his first entering a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.87" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="lowest" score="0.87">lowest</span>, this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="truth" newWord="clergy" score="0.772">clergy</span> is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>property</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.907" formerWord="property" newWord="interchange" score="0.907">interchange</span> of some one or other of their daughters. 
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet,"said his lady to him <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.607" formerWord="one" newWord="another" score="0.607">another</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span>,"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
<p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. 
<p>"But it is,"returned she;"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
<p>Mr. Bennet made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.688">apology</span>. 
<p>"Do you not want to know who has taken it?"cried his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.791">son</span> impatiently. 
<p>"You want to tell me, and I have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>objection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="objection" newWord="harm" score="0.804">harm</span> to hearing it."
<p>This was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="invitation" newWord="apartment" score="0.797">apartment</span> enough. 
<p>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span> of large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.794">sense</span> from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>north</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.913" formerWord="north" newWord="rehearsal" score="0.913">rehearsal</span> of England; that he came down on Monday in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chaise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.921" formerWord="chaise" newWord="stroll" score="0.921">stroll</span> and four to see the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.634" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.634">house</span>, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>possession</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.886" formerWord="possession" newWord="treatment" score="0.886">treatment</span> before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="house" newWord="evening" score="0.749">evening</span> by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="end" newWord="baronet" score="0.703">baronet</span> of next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="week" newWord="year" score="0.817">year</span>."

<p>"Bingley."
<p>"Is he married or single?"
<p>"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span> of large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.794">sense</span>; four or five thousand a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="year" newWord="week" score="0.817">week</span>. What a fine <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.795">body</span> for our girls!"
<p>"How so? How can it affect them?"
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet,"replied his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.791">son</span>,"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
<p>"Is that his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="design" newWord="happiness" score="0.747">happiness</span> in settling here?"
<p>"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="Design" newWord="happiness" score="0.747">Happiness</span>! <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nonsense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.779" formerWord="Nonsense" newWord="likeness" score="0.779">Likeness</span>, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="love" newWord="err" score="0.577">err</span> with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
<p>"I see no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="occasion" newWord="china" score="0.68">china</span> for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.858">whole</span>."
<p>"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>share</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="share" newWord="nicety" score="0.777">nicety</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.801" formerWord="beauty" newWord="youth" score="0.801">youth</span>, but I do not pretend to be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.778">anybody</span> extraordinary now. When a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.911">man</span> has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thinking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.752" formerWord="thinking" newWord="aware" score="0.752">aware</span> of her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.801" formerWord="beauty" newWord="youth" score="0.801">youth</span>."
<p>"In such cases, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.911">man</span> has not often much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.801" formerWord="beauty" newWord="youth" score="0.801">youth</span> to think of."
<p>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.87" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="lowest" score="0.87">lowest</span>."
<p>"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
<p>"But consider your daughters. Only think what an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>establishment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="establishment" newWord="immediate" score="0.776">immediate</span> it would be for one of them.

Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not."
<p>"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.753" formerWord="consent" newWord="prevent" score="0.753">prevent</span> to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.772">soul</span> for my little Lizzy."
<p>"I <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="desire" newWord="command" score="0.747">command</span> you will do no such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.795">body</span>. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="half" newWord="hour" score="0.719">hour</span> so handsome as Jane, nor <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="half" newWord="hour" score="0.719">hour</span> so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>preference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="preference" newWord="glory" score="0.889">glory</span>."
<p>"They have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.685" formerWord="none" newWord="arisen" score="0.685">arisen</span> of them much to recommend them,"replied he;"they are all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silly</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="silly" newWord="tempered" score="0.841">tempered</span> and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.716" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.716">anything</span> more of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quickness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.862" formerWord="quickness" newWord="professions" score="0.862">professions</span> than her sisters."
<p>"Mr. Bennet, how can you <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>abuse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="abuse" newWord="bias" score="0.703">bias</span> your own children in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.605">place</span>? You take <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="delight" newWord="dignity" score="0.813">dignity</span> in vexing me. You have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="compassion" newWord="judgement" score="0.839">judgement</span> for my poor nerves."
<p>"You <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mistake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.824" formerWord="mistake" newWord="repent" score="0.824">repent</span> me, my dear.

<p>"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
<p>"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="year" newWord="week" score="0.817">week</span> come into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.87" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="lowest" score="0.87">lowest</span>."
<p>"It will be no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>use</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.746" formerWord="use" newWord="sacrifice" score="0.746">sacrifice</span> to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
<p>"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."
<p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mixture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.906" formerWord="mixture" newWord="simplicity" score="0.906">simplicity</span> of quick parts, sarcastic <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="humour" newWord="humoured" score="0.859">humoured</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.886" formerWord="reserve" newWord="charitable" score="0.886">charitable</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>caprice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.877" formerWord="caprice" newWord="wit" score="0.877">wit</span>, that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>experience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.812" formerWord="experience" newWord="measure" score="0.812">measure</span> of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.791">son</span> understand his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="character" newWord="sense" score="0.73">sense</span>. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.697" formerWord="mind" newWord="heart" score="0.697">heart</span> was less difficult to develop.

<p>Chapter 2 
<p>
<p>Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.791">son</span> that he should not go; and till the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.801" formerWord="evening" newWord="inn" score="0.801">inn</span> after the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.71" formerWord="visit" newWord="accompany" score="0.71">accompany</span> was paid she had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>knowledge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="knowledge" newWord="delicacy" score="0.842">delicacy</span> of it. It was then disclosed in the following <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.709" formerWord="manner" newWord="tone" score="0.709">tone</span>. Observing his second <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="daughter" newWord="conduct" score="0.796">conduct</span> employed in trimming a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.681" formerWord="hat" newWord="principles" score="0.681">principles</span>, he suddenly addressed her with: 
<p>"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."
<p>"We are not in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.605">place</span> to know what Mr. Bingley likes,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span> resentfully,"since we are not to visit."
<p>"But you forget, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.693" formerWord="mamma" newWord="ma" score="0.693">ma</span>,"said Elizabeth,"that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."
<p>"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.795">body</span>. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.911">man</span>, and I have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.755" formerWord="opinion" newWord="conduct" score="0.755">conduct</span> of her."
<p>"No more have I,"said Mr. Bennet;"and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."
<p>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters. 
<p>"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.736" formerWord="sake" newWord="partiality" score="0.736">partiality</span>!

<p>"Aye, so it is,"cried her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span>,"and Mrs. Long does not come back till the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span> before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."
<p>"Then, my dear, you may have the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="advantage" newWord="extremity" score="0.833">extremity</span> of your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.792">brother</span>, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her."
<p>"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?"
<p>"I <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="honour" newWord="refusal" score="0.743">refusal</span> your circumspection.

<p>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.763" formerWord="part" newWord="species" score="0.763">species</span> of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span>, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.705" formerWord="conversation" newWord="earnestness" score="0.705">earnestness</span> between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.78" formerWord="dance" newWord="keep" score="0.78">keep</span> for a few minutes, to press his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.792">brother</span> to join it.

<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.801" formerWord="evening" newWord="inn" score="0.801">inn</span> altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.664" formerWord="family" newWord="children" score="0.664">children</span>.

Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.

First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her!

<p>"He is just what a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span> ought to be,"said she,"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sensible</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.673" formerWord="sensible" newWord="ignorant" score="0.673">ignorant</span>, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! - - so much ease, with such perfect good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breeding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.831" formerWord="breeding" newWord="principles" score="0.831">principles</span>!"
<p>"He is also handsome,"replied Elizabeth,"which a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span> ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.

What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.911">man</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>.

Their manners are not equal to his."
<p>"Certainly not - - at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.

<p>Their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="brother" newWord="sister" score="0.842">sister</span>, indeed, was the only one of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.858">whole</span> whom she could regard with any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>complacency</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="complacency" newWord="goodwill" score="0.922">goodwill</span>.

She had very little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="notice" newWord="knowledge" score="0.789">knowledge</span> from any but him.

<p>When <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dinner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="dinner" newWord="breakfast" score="0.793">breakfast</span> was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>.

<p>"You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,"said Miss Bingley;"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span> make such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>exhibition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.874" formerWord="exhibition" newWord="management" score="0.874">management</span>."
<p>"Certainly not."

<p>"If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,"cried Bingley,"it would not make them one jot less agreeable."

<p>When <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.744" formerWord="tea" newWord="breakfast" score="0.744">breakfast</span> was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table - - but in vain.

<p>"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.685" formerWord="ball" newWord="mischief" score="0.685">mischief</span>."
<p>Miss Bingley made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.688">apology</span>, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>figure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="figure" newWord="warm" score="0.829">warm</span> was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.607" formerWord="one" newWord="another" score="0.607">another</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>effort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="effort" newWord="flattering" score="0.807">flattering</span> more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said: 
<p>"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>example</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.85" formerWord="example" newWord="beauties" score="0.85">beauties</span>, and take a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>turn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="turn" newWord="retire" score="0.783">retire</span> about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>.

<p>Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="object" newWord="evil" score="0.7">evil</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>civility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="civility" newWord="emotion" score="0.762">emotion</span>; Mr. Darcy looked up.

He was directly invited to join their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.858">whole</span>, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>choosing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.594" formerWord="choosing" newWord="bow" score="0.594">bow</span> to walk up and down the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span> together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere."What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meaning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.695" formerWord="meaning" newWord="dutiful" score="0.695">dutiful</span>?"- - and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him? 
<p>"Not at all,"was her answer;"but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.605">place</span> of disappointing him will be to ask <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">something</span> about it."
<p>Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.778">anybody</span>, and persevered therefore in requiring an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>explanation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="explanation" newWord="blindness" score="0.833">blindness</span> of his two motives.

<p>"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!"cried Elizabeth."That is an uncommon <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="advantage" newWord="extremity" score="0.833">extremity</span>, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>loss</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.862" formerWord="loss" newWord="instance" score="0.862">instance</span> to me to have many such acquaintances.

But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="week" newWord="year" score="0.817">year</span>, could not bring herself to receive them with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.609" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="share" score="0.609">share</span> before. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.688">apology</span>, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="home" newWord="lyme" score="0.707">lyme</span>. Mrs. Bennet sent them <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.772">soul</span> that they could not possibly have the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.816" formerWord="carriage" newWord="window" score="0.816">window</span> before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span> pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved - - nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.816" formerWord="carriage" newWord="window" score="0.816">window</span> immediately, and at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>length</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.805" formerWord="length" newWord="intervals" score="0.805">intervals</span> it was settled that their original <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="design" newWord="happiness" score="0.747">happiness</span> of leaving Netherfield that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.823">day</span> should be mentioned, and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>request</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="request" newWord="appeal" score="0.796">appeal</span> made. 
<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>communication</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.907" formerWord="communication" newWord="earliest" score="0.907">earliest</span> excited many professions of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>concern</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="concern" newWord="reluctance" score="0.808">reluctance</span>; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span> to work on Jane; and till the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morrow</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="morrow" newWord="retire" score="0.759">retire</span> their going was deferred.

She attracted him more than he liked - - and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her, and more teasing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sign</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.697" formerWord="sign" newWord="fear" score="0.697">fear</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>admiration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="admiration" newWord="cheerfulness" score="0.847">cheerfulness</span> should now escape him, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">something</span> that could elevate her with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hope</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="hope" newWord="intend" score="0.749">intend</span> of influencing his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>felicity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.882" formerWord="felicity" newWord="obligation" score="0.882">obligation</span>; <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sensible</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.673" formerWord="sensible" newWord="ignorant" score="0.673">ignorant</span> that if such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="idea" newWord="opportunity" score="0.791">opportunity</span> had been suggested, his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="daughter" score="0.773">daughter</span> during the last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span> must have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>material</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.849" formerWord="material" newWord="danger" score="0.849">danger</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>weight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="weight" newWord="plea" score="0.777">plea</span> in confirming or crushing it.

<p>Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.

<p>"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this - - though I have never liked him.

<p>"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want abilities.

It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.

<p>Even Elizabeth began to fear - - not that Bingley was indifferent - - but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,"said she,"it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mistress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="mistress" newWord="glimpse" score="0.809">glimpse</span> of this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="house" newWord="evening" score="0.749">evening</span>, that I should be forced to make <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.605">place</span> for her, and live to see her take her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.634" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.634">house</span> in it!"

<p>This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.688">apology</span>, she went on as before.

<p>After a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="week" newWord="year" score="0.817">year</span> spent in professions of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="love" newWord="err" score="0.577">err</span> and schemes of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>felicity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.882" formerWord="felicity" newWord="obligation" score="0.882">obligation</span>, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="arrival" newWord="entering" score="0.828">entering</span> of Saturday.

<p>On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.609" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="share" score="0.609">share</span> of receiving her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="brother" newWord="sister" score="0.842">sister</span> and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.791">son</span>, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sensible</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.673" formerWord="sensible" newWord="ignorant" score="0.673">ignorant</span>, gentlemanlike <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span>, greatly superior to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>, as well by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.734" formerWord="nature" newWord="consequence" score="0.734">consequence</span> as <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>education</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.882" formerWord="education" newWord="youth" score="0.882">youth</span>. The Netherfield ladies would have had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>difficulty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="difficulty" newWord="motive" score="0.781">motive</span> in believing that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span> who lived by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trade</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.825" formerWord="trade" newWord="pair" score="0.825">pair</span>, and within <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.881" formerWord="view" newWord="intercourse" score="0.881">intercourse</span> of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.911">man</span>, and a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>favourite</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.726" formerWord="favourite" newWord="hands" score="0.726">hands</span> with all her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Longbourn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.915" formerWord="Longbourn" newWord="rosings" score="0.915">Rosings</span> nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.661" formerWord="regard" newWord="entreaty" score="0.661">entreaty</span>. They had frequently been staying with her in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.804">bath</span>. 
<p>The first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.763" formerWord="part" newWord="species" score="0.763">species</span> of Mrs. Gardiner's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="business" newWord="assembly" score="0.725">assembly</span> on her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="arrival" newWord="entering" score="0.828">entering</span> was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.763" formerWord="part" newWord="species" score="0.763">species</span> to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>. Two of her girls had been upon the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="point" newWord="subject" score="0.756">subject</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="marriage" newWord="motives" score="0.777">motives</span>, and after all there was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">something</span> in it. 
<p>"I do not blame Jane,"she continued,"for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.791">son</span> by this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span>, had it not been for her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>perverseness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="perverseness" newWord="recital" score="0.875">recital</span>. He made her an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>offer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.729" formerWord="offer" newWord="escape" score="0.729">escape</span> in this very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>, and she refused him. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consequence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.816" formerWord="consequence" newWord="exertion" score="0.816">exertion</span> of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="daughter" newWord="conduct" score="0.796">conduct</span> married before I have, and that the Longbourn <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>estate</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.805" formerWord="estate" newWord="inferiority" score="0.805">inferiority</span> is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.664" formerWord="family" newWord="children" score="0.664">children</span>, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.812" formerWord="anybody" newWord="myself" score="0.812">myself</span> else. However, your coming just at this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span> is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."
<p>Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.899" formerWord="chief" newWord="departure" score="0.899">departure</span> of this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>news</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="news" newWord="nation" score="0.784">nation</span> had been given before, in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="course" newWord="france" score="0.749">france</span> of Jane and Elizabeth's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>correspondence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.755" formerWord="correspondence" newWord="regrets" score="0.755">regrets</span> with her, made her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span> a slight <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.688">apology</span>, and, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="compassion" newWord="judgement" score="0.839">judgement</span> to her nieces, turned the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.705" formerWord="conversation" newWord="earnestness" score="0.705">earnestness</span>. 
<p>When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.756">point</span>."It seems likely to have been a desirable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.662" formerWord="match" newWord="mischief" score="0.662">mischief</span> for Jane,"said she."I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span>, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="love" newWord="err" score="0.577">err</span> with a pretty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.831" formerWord="girl" newWord="fellow" score="0.831">fellow</span> for a few weeks, and when <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accident</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.76" formerWord="accident" newWord="slight" score="0.76">slight</span> separates them, so easily forgets her, that these <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.716" formerWord="sort" newWord="species" score="0.716">species</span> of inconsistencies are very frequent."
<p>"An excellent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consolation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="consolation" newWord="solitude" score="0.802">solitude</span> in its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.605">place</span>,"said Elizabeth,"but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accident</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.76" formerWord="accident" newWord="slight" score="0.76">slight</span>. It does not often happen that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.782" formerWord="interference" newWord="offices" score="0.782">offices</span> of friends will persuade a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span> of independent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="fortune" newWord="sense" score="0.794">sense</span> to think no more of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.831" formerWord="girl" newWord="fellow" score="0.831">fellow</span> whom he was violently in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="love" newWord="err" score="0.577">err</span> with only a few days before."
<p>"But that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>expression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="expression" newWord="ecstasy" score="0.869">ecstasy</span> of ' violently in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="love" newWord="err" score="0.577">err</span> ' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="idea" newWord="opportunity" score="0.791">opportunity</span>. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquaintance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="acquaintance" newWord="friends" score="0.68">friends</span>, as to a real, strong <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="attachment" newWord="affection" score="0.789">affection</span>. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley's love?"
<p>"I never saw a more promising <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inclination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="inclination" newWord="inconsiderable" score="0.751">inconsiderable</span>; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span> they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.685" formerWord="ball" newWord="mischief" score="0.685">mischief</span> he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.78" formerWord="dance" newWord="keep" score="0.78">keep</span>; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.688">apology</span>. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>incivility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="incivility" newWord="castle" score="0.605">castle</span> the very essence of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="love" newWord="err" score="0.577">err</span>?"
<p>"Oh, yes! - - of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="kind" newWord="sort" score="0.704">sort</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="love" newWord="err" score="0.577">err</span> which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disposition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="disposition" newWord="indifference" score="0.803">indifference</span>, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scene</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.876" formerWord="scene" newWord="green" score="0.876">green</span> might be of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>service</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="service" newWord="maintenance" score="0.869">maintenance</span> - - and perhaps a little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="relief" newWord="promote" score="0.829">promote</span> from <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="home" newWord="lyme" score="0.707">lyme</span> may be as useful as <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.778">anybody</span>."
<p>Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proposal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="proposal" newWord="glory" score="0.864">glory</span>, and felt persuaded of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>'s ready <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquiescence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.884" formerWord="acquiescence" newWord="proposals" score="0.884">proposals</span>. 
<p>"I hope,"added Mrs. Gardiner,"that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="consideration" newWord="instance" score="0.688">instance</span> with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.661" formerWord="regard" newWord="entreaty" score="0.661">entreaty</span> to this young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span> will influence her. We live in so different a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.763" formerWord="part" newWord="species" score="0.763">species</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.804">bath</span>, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."
<p>"And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.792">brother</span>, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.763" formerWord="part" newWord="species" score="0.763">species</span> of London! My dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="aunt" newWord="mother" score="0.818">mother</span>, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.634" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.634">house</span> as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>month</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.682" formerWord="month" newWord="fortnight" score="0.682">fortnight</span>'s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him."
<p>"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>? She will not be able to help calling."

<p>"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."
<p>"I beg your pardon, I will try again.

In short, I will do my best."
<p>"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span> of inviting him."

<p>"Well,"cried Elizabeth,"have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish."

<p>"My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span> would have had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>objection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="objection" newWord="harm" score="0.804">harm</span>, but my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.873" formerWord="father" newWord="sister" score="0.873">sister</span> hates London."

<p>"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."
<p>"Aye, no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="doubt" newWord="harm" score="0.795">harm</span>; but that is what a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>governess</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="governess" newWord="beautifully" score="0.839">beautifully</span> will prevent, and if I had known your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span>, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.

<p>"Yes, ma'am, all."
<p>"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?"
<p>"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.

<p>Elizabeth had scarcely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span> to disclaim all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>right</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.686" formerWord="right" newWord="amelia" score="0.686">amelia</span> to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compliment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.745" formerWord="compliment" newWord="duty" score="0.745">duty</span>, before their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>approach</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.887" formerWord="approach" newWord="ground" score="0.887">ground</span> was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>.

<p>Chapter 31 
<p>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="invitation" newWord="apartment" score="0.797">apartment</span> thither - - for while there were visitors in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="house" newWord="evening" score="0.749">evening</span>, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="week" newWord="year" score="0.817">year</span> after the gentlemen's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="arrival" newWord="entering" score="0.828">entering</span>, that they were honoured by such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="attention" newWord="passion" score="0.759">passion</span>, and then they were merely asked on leaving <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>church</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="church" newWord="grants" score="0.875">grants</span> to come there in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.801" formerWord="evening" newWord="inn" score="0.801">inn</span>. For the last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="week" newWord="year" score="0.817">year</span> they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="daughter" newWord="conduct" score="0.796">conduct</span>.

<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="invitation" newWord="apartment" score="0.797">apartment</span> was accepted of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="course" newWord="france" score="0.749">france</span>, and at a proper <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="hour" newWord="half" score="0.719">half</span> they joined the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.858">whole</span> in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ladyship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="ladyship" newWord="uncle" score="0.822">uncle</span> received them civilly, but it was plain that their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>company</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="company" newWord="connections" score="0.675">connections</span> was by no means so acceptable as when she could get <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nobody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.798" formerWord="nobody" newWord="somebody" score="0.798">somebody</span> else; and she was, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fact</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.659" formerWord="fact" newWord="remarkable" score="0.659">remarkable</span>, almost engrossed by her nephews, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="speaking" newWord="talking" score="0.672">talking</span> to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="person" newWord="circumstances" score="0.719">circumstances</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>. 
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.778">anybody</span> was a welcome <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="relief" newWord="promote" score="0.829">promote</span> to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.792">brother</span> had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="home" newWord="lyme" score="0.707">lyme</span>, of new books and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>music</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="music" newWord="wit" score="0.859">wit</span>, that Elizabeth had never been <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="half" newWord="hour" score="0.719">hour</span> so well entertained in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span> before; and they conversed with so much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>spirit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.849" formerWord="spirit" newWord="proofs" score="0.849">proofs</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>flow</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="flow" newWord="proceedings" score="0.935">proceedings</span>, as to draw the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="attention" newWord="passion" score="0.759">passion</span> of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy.

<p>"We are <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="speaking" newWord="talking" score="0.672">talking</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>music</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="music" newWord="wit" score="0.859">wit</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>madam</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="madam" newWord="lizzy" score="0.822">lizzy</span>,"said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.

<p>Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="praise" newWord="preference" score="0.804">preference</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>'s proficiency.

<p>"I shall not say you are mistaken,"he replied,"because you could not really believe me to entertain any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="design" newWord="happiness" score="0.747">happiness</span> of alarming you; and I have had the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.609" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="share" score="0.609">share</span> of your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquaintance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="acquaintance" newWord="friends" score="0.68">friends</span> long enough to know that you find great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>enjoyment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.865" formerWord="enjoyment" newWord="expectation" score="0.865">expectation</span> in occasionally professing opinions which in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fact</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.659" formerWord="fact" newWord="remarkable" score="0.659">remarkable</span> are not your own."
<p>Elizabeth laughed heartily at this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>picture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="picture" newWord="instance" score="0.845">instance</span> of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam,"Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="cousin" newWord="dearest" score="0.756">dearest</span> will give you a very pretty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.726" formerWord="notion" newWord="shadow" score="0.726">shadow</span> of me, and teach you not to believe a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.772">soul</span> I say.

<p>"I am not afraid of you,"said he, smilingly. 
<p>"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,"cried Colonel Fitzwilliam."I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."
<p>"You shall hear then - - but prepare yourself for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.716" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.716">anything</span> very dreadful.

<p>Darcy smiled and said,"You are perfectly right.

<p>Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy: 
<p>"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="advantage" newWord="extremity" score="0.833">extremity</span> of a London <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.8" formerWord="master" newWord="accepting" score="0.8">accepting</span>.

<p>Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="cousin" newWord="dearest" score="0.756">dearest</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="praise" newWord="preference" score="0.804">preference</span>; but neither at that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.659" formerWord="moment" newWord="pemberley" score="0.659">pemberley</span> nor at any other could she discern any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>symptom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.687" formerWord="symptom" newWord="suspicion" score="0.687">suspicion</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="love" newWord="err" score="0.577">err</span>; and from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="whole" newWord="party" score="0.858">party</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="daughter" score="0.773">daughter</span> to Miss de Bourgh she derived this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>comfort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.733" formerWord="comfort" newWord="use" score="0.733">use</span> for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.844" formerWord="relation" newWord="contempt" score="0.844">contempt</span>.

As she had heard no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.816" formerWord="carriage" newWord="window" score="0.816">window</span>, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>apprehension</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="apprehension" newWord="inferiority" score="0.86">inferiority</span> was putting away her half-finished <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.648" formerWord="letter" newWord="name" score="0.648">name</span> that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="door" newWord="table" score="0.857">table</span> opened, and, to her very great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="surprise" newWord="heartfelt" score="0.672">heartfelt</span>, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>. 
<p>He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intrusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.824" formerWord="intrusion" newWord="increase" score="0.824">increase</span> by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within. 
<p>They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>danger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.849" formerWord="danger" newWord="material" score="0.849">material</span> of sinking into total <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.726" formerWord="silence" newWord="shortly" score="0.726">shortly</span>.

<p>"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!

He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?"
<p>"Perfectly so, I thank you."
<p>She found that she was to receive no other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.688">apology</span>, and, after a short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.695" formerWord="pause" newWord="pausing" score="0.695">pausing</span> added:

<p>"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span> there in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>future</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="future" newWord="apartment" score="0.828">apartment</span>.

<p>"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.87" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="lowest" score="0.87">lowest</span> that he should give up the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.634" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.634">house</span> entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.664" formerWord="family" newWord="children" score="0.664">children</span> there.

<p>As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.709" formerWord="manner" newWord="tone" score="0.709">tone</span> in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uneasiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.815" formerWord="uneasiness" newWord="distinguishing" score="0.815">distinguishing</span>, convinced her that she had somehow or other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>got</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.723" formerWord="got" newWord="parted" score="0.723">parted</span> pretty near the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="truth" newWord="clergy" score="0.772">clergy</span>.

<p>"Oh! yes,"said Elizabeth drily;"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="kind" newWord="sort" score="0.704">sort</span> to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.581" formerWord="deal" newWord="too" score="0.581">too</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>care</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.624" formerWord="care" newWord="want" score="0.624">want</span> of him."
<p>"Care of him!

<p>"It is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>circumstance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.798" formerWord="circumstance" newWord="light" score="0.798">light</span> which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="round" newWord="door" score="0.823">door</span> to the lady's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.664" formerWord="family" newWord="children" score="0.664">children</span>, it would be an unpleasant <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.795">body</span>."
<p>"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."
<p>"And remember that I have not much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.786" formerWord="reason" newWord="objection" score="0.786">objection</span> for supposing it to be Bingley.

<p>"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady."
<p>"And what arts did he use to separate them?"
<p>"He did not talk to me of his own arts,"said Fitzwilliam, smiling."He only told me what I have now told you."
<p>Elizabeth made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.688">apology</span>, and walked on, her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.805" formerWord="heart" newWord="mother" score="0.805">mother</span> swelling with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indignation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.809" formerWord="indignation" newWord="grief" score="0.809">grief</span>. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful. 
<p>"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,"said she."Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="cousin" newWord="dearest" score="0.756">dearest</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conduct</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="conduct" newWord="wishes" score="0.845">wishes</span> does not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>suit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.834" formerWord="suit" newWord="disappoint" score="0.834">disappoint</span> my feelings.

<p>"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>propriety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="propriety" newWord="exercise" score="0.893">exercise</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.792">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inclination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="inclination" newWord="inconsiderable" score="0.751">inconsiderable</span>, or why, upon his own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judgement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="judgement" newWord="knees" score="0.86">knees</span> alone, he was to determine and direct in what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.709" formerWord="manner" newWord="tone" score="0.709">tone</span> his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.792">brother</span> was to be happy.

<p>"That is not an unnatural surmise,"said Fitzwilliam,"but it is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lessening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.686" formerWord="lessening" newWord="hearers" score="0.686">hearers</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="honour" newWord="refusal" score="0.743">refusal</span> of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="cousin" newWord="dearest" score="0.756">dearest</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>triumph</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.888" formerWord="triumph" newWord="dignity" score="0.888">dignity</span> very sadly."
<p>This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>picture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="picture" newWord="instance" score="0.845">instance</span> of Mr. Darcy, that she would not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trust</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.815" formerWord="trust" newWord="ask" score="0.815">ask</span> herself with an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.688">apology</span>, and therefore, abruptly changing the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.705" formerWord="conversation" newWord="earnestness" score="0.705">earnestness</span> talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage.

That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="design" newWord="happiness" score="0.747">happiness</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrangement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.895" formerWord="arrangement" newWord="hero" score="0.895">hero</span> of them.

<p>When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>employment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.849" formerWord="employment" newWord="invitations" score="0.849">invitations</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>examination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.9" formerWord="examination" newWord="assurance" score="0.9">assurance</span> of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>complaint</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="complaint" newWord="coles" score="0.86">coles</span>, nor was there any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>revival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="revival" newWord="dignity" score="0.792">dignity</span> of past occurrences, or any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>communication</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.907" formerWord="communication" newWord="earliest" score="0.907">earliest</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>present</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="present" newWord="least" score="0.675">least</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>suffering</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.812" formerWord="suffering" newWord="forming" score="0.812">forming</span>. But in all, and in almost every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>line</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="line" newWord="falling" score="0.866">falling</span> of each, there was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="want" newWord="use" score="0.704">use</span> of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cheerfulness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="cheerfulness" newWord="sensibility" score="0.903">sensibility</span> which had been used to characterise her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>style</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.878" formerWord="style" newWord="proportion" score="0.878">proportion</span>, and which, proceeding from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>serenity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.831" formerWord="serenity" newWord="fraternal" score="0.831">fraternal</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.697" formerWord="mind" newWord="heart" score="0.697">heart</span> at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ease</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.767" formerWord="ease" newWord="horror" score="0.767">horror</span> with itself and kindly disposed towards <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everyone</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.726" formerWord="everyone" newWord="grieving" score="0.726">grieving</span>, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sentence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="sentence" newWord="lingering" score="0.833">lingering</span> conveying the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="idea" newWord="opportunity" score="0.791">opportunity</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uneasiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.815" formerWord="uneasiness" newWord="distinguishing" score="0.815">distinguishing</span>, with an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="attention" newWord="passion" score="0.759">passion</span> which it had hardly received on the first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>perusal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.931" formerWord="perusal" newWord="centre" score="0.931">centre</span>.

It was some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consolation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="consolation" newWord="solitude" score="0.802">solitude</span> to think that his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.71" formerWord="visit" newWord="accompany" score="0.71">accompany</span> to Rosings was to end on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span> after the next - - and, a still greater, that in less than a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.732" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="taunton" score="0.732">taunton</span> she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>recovery</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="recovery" newWord="application" score="0.792">application</span> of her spirits, by all that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="affection" newWord="attachment" score="0.789">attachment</span> could do. 
<p>She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="cousin" newWord="dearest" score="0.756">dearest</span> was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him. 
<p>While settling this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="point" newWord="subject" score="0.756">subject</span>, she was suddenly roused by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sound</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.882" formerWord="sound" newWord="events" score="0.882">events</span> of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="idea" newWord="opportunity" score="0.791">opportunity</span> of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.801" formerWord="evening" newWord="inn" score="0.801">inn</span>, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="idea" newWord="opportunity" score="0.791">opportunity</span> was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amazement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.77" formerWord="amazement" newWord="dressing" score="0.77">dressing</span>, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>. In an hurried <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.709" formerWord="manner" newWord="tone" score="0.709">tone</span> he immediately began an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inquiry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="inquiry" newWord="information" score="0.756">information</span> after her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>health</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="health" newWord="convenience" score="0.851">convenience</span>, imputing his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.71" formerWord="visit" newWord="accompany" score="0.71">accompany</span> to a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.705" formerWord="wish" newWord="preferment" score="0.705">preferment</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hearing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.633" formerWord="hearing" newWord="disapprobation" score="0.633">disapprobation</span> that she were better. She answered him with cold <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>civility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="civility" newWord="emotion" score="0.762">emotion</span>. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.772">soul</span>. After a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.726" formerWord="silence" newWord="shortly" score="0.726">shortly</span> of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.709" formerWord="manner" newWord="tone" score="0.709">tone</span>, and thus began: 
<p>"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."
<p>Elizabeth's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>astonishment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.771" formerWord="astonishment" newWord="grief" score="0.771">grief</span> was beyond <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>expression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="expression" newWord="ecstasy" score="0.869">ecstasy</span>. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>encouragement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="encouragement" newWord="throw" score="0.854">throw</span>; and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>avowal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="avowal" newWord="belief" score="0.806">belief</span> of all that he felt, and had long <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>felt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.664" formerWord="felt" newWord="found" score="0.664">found</span> for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.805" formerWord="heart" newWord="mother" score="0.805">mother</span> to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.756">point</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tenderness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.884" formerWord="tenderness" newWord="sweetness" score="0.884">sweetness</span> than of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="pride" newWord="taste" score="0.735">taste</span>. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="sense" newWord="fortune" score="0.794">fortune</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inferiority</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.9" formerWord="inferiority" newWord="impossibility" score="0.9">impossibility</span> - - of its being a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>degradation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="degradation" newWord="performance" score="0.854">performance</span> - - of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.664" formerWord="family" newWord="children" score="0.664">children</span> obstacles which had always opposed to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inclination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="inclination" newWord="inconsiderable" score="0.751">inconsiderable</span>, were dwelt on with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>warmth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.849" formerWord="warmth" newWord="consciousness" score="0.849">consciousness</span> which seemed due to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consequence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.816" formerWord="consequence" newWord="exertion" score="0.816">exertion</span> he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>suit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.834" formerWord="suit" newWord="disappoint" score="0.834">disappoint</span>.

She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>patience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="patience" newWord="invitations" score="0.793">invitations</span>, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>strength</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.9" formerWord="strength" newWord="restraints" score="0.9">restraints</span> of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="attachment" newWord="affection" score="0.789">affection</span> which, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>spite</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="spite" newWord="quest" score="0.822">quest</span> of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hope</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="hope" newWord="intend" score="0.749">intend</span> that it would now be rewarded by her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acceptance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="acceptance" newWord="accompanying" score="0.778">accompanying</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hand</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.721" formerWord="hand" newWord="lips" score="0.721">lips</span>. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="doubt" newWord="harm" score="0.795">harm</span> of a favourable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.688" formerWord="answer" newWord="apology" score="0.688">apology</span>.

Such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>circumstance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.798" formerWord="circumstance" newWord="light" score="0.798">light</span> could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said: 
<p>"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mode</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.912" formerWord="mode" newWord="prospect" score="0.912">prospect</span> to express a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="sense" newWord="fortune" score="0.794">fortune</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>obligation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.897" formerWord="obligation" newWord="masters" score="0.897">masters</span> for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>obligation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.897" formerWord="obligation" newWord="masters" score="0.897">masters</span> should be felt, and if I could feel <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gratitude</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.812" formerWord="gratitude" newWord="displeasure" score="0.812">displeasure</span>, I would now <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thank</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="thank" newWord="please" score="0.841">please</span> you.

<p>Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mantelpiece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.876" formerWord="mantelpiece" newWord="cobb" score="0.876">cobb</span> with his eyes fixed on her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>face</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.831" formerWord="face" newWord="eye" score="0.831">eye</span>, seemed to catch her words with no less <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resentment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="resentment" newWord="ignorance" score="0.817">ignorance</span> than <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="surprise" newWord="heartfelt" score="0.672">heartfelt</span>. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>complexion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.853" formerWord="complexion" newWord="principles" score="0.853">principles</span> became pale with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="anger" newWord="reproaches" score="0.773">reproaches</span>, and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disturbance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.767" formerWord="disturbance" newWord="deed" score="0.767">deed</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.697" formerWord="mind" newWord="heart" score="0.697">heart</span> was visible in every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>feature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="feature" newWord="differing" score="0.869">differing</span>.

The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.695" formerWord="pause" newWord="pausing" score="0.695">pausing</span> was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful.

<p>"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,"said she,"and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disappointment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="disappointment" newWord="needlework" score="0.833">needlework</span>!"
<p>"Indeed,"replied Elizabeth,"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.661" formerWord="regard" newWord="entreaty" score="0.661">entreaty</span> for me.

<p>"Blame you! Oh, no."
<p>"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"
<p>"No - - I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."

<p>She then spoke of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.648" formerWord="letter" newWord="name" score="0.648">name</span>, repeating the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="whole" newWord="party" score="0.858">party</span> of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.

<p>"This will not do,"said Elizabeth;"you never will be able to make both of them good for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.778">anybody</span>.

<p>It was some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span>, however, before a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.588" formerWord="smile" newWord="astonished" score="0.588">astonished</span> could be extorted from Jane. 
<p>"I do not know when I have been more shocked,"said she."Wickham so very bad!

<p>"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>education</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.882" formerWord="education" newWord="youth" score="0.882">youth</span> of those two young men.

<p>"Lizzy, when you first read that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.648" formerWord="letter" newWord="name" score="0.648">name</span>, I am sure you could not treat the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="matter" newWord="case" score="0.735">case</span> as you do now."
<p>"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy.

<p>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.856" formerWord="niece" newWord="nieces" score="0.856">nieces</span> with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.588" formerWord="smile" newWord="astonished" score="0.588">astonished</span>, but Elizabeth could not return it.

<p>Mrs. Reynolds <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>respect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.682" formerWord="respect" newWord="audible" score="0.682">audible</span> for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intimation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.876" formerWord="intimation" newWord="prospect" score="0.876">prospect</span> of her knowing her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.8" formerWord="master" newWord="accepting" score="0.8">accepting</span>. 
<p>"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"
<p>Elizabeth coloured, and said:"A little."
<p>"And do not you think him a very handsome <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.65" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="apricot" score="0.65">apricot</span>, ma'am?"
<p>"Yes, very handsome."

He was very fond of them."
<p>This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them. 
<p>Mrs. Reynolds then directed their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="attention" newWord="passion" score="0.759">passion</span> to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old. 
<p>"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="brother" newWord="sister" score="0.842">sister</span>?"said Mrs. Gardiner. 
<p>"Oh! yes - - the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished! - - She plays and sings all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span> long.

<p>Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="pride" newWord="taste" score="0.735">taste</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="attachment" newWord="affection" score="0.789">affection</span>, had evidently great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.609" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="share" score="0.609">share</span> in talking of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.8" formerWord="master" newWord="accepting" score="0.8">accepting</span> and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>. 
<p>"Is your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.8" formerWord="master" newWord="accepting" score="0.8">accepting</span> much at Pemberley in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="course" newWord="france" score="0.749">france</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="year" newWord="week" score="0.817">week</span>?"
<p>"Not so much as I could wish, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.554" formerWord="sir" newWord="colouring" score="0.554">colouring</span>; but I dare say he may spend <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="half" newWord="hour" score="0.719">hour</span> his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span> here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>summer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="summer" newWord="afternoon" score="0.839">afternoon</span> months."
<p>"Except,"thought Elizabeth,"when she goes to Ramsgate."
<p>"If your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.8" formerWord="master" newWord="accepting" score="0.8">accepting</span> would marry, you might see more of him."
<p>"Yes, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.554" formerWord="sir" newWord="colouring" score="0.554">colouring</span>; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him."
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying,"It is very much to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>credit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.755" formerWord="credit" newWord="inconvenience" score="0.755">inconvenience</span>, I am sure, that you should think so."

<p>This was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="praise" newWord="preference" score="0.804">preference</span>, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.

<p>Elizabeth almost stared at her."Can this be Mr. Darcy?"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thought</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="thought" newWord="felt" score="0.653">felt</span> she.

<p>Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="character" newWord="sense" score="0.73">sense</span>, but said <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">something</span>. 
<p>"From what we have seen of him,"continued Mrs. Gardiner,"I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.605">place</span> by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.812" formerWord="anybody" newWord="myself" score="0.812">myself</span> as he has done by poor Wickham.

<p>The occurrences of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span> were too full of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.717" formerWord="interest" newWord="design" score="0.717">design</span> to leave Elizabeth much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="attention" newWord="passion" score="0.759">passion</span> for any of these new friends; and she could do <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">something</span> but think, and think with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wonder</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.65" formerWord="wonder" newWord="imagine" score="0.65">imagine</span>, of Mr. Darcy's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>civility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="civility" newWord="emotion" score="0.762">emotion</span>, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>.

<p>Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span> to visit her the very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span> after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="sight" newWord="courtship" score="0.864">courtship</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.879" formerWord="inn" newWord="parsonage" score="0.879">parsonage</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="whole" newWord="party" score="0.858">party</span> of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.823">day</span>.

<p>She retreated from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>window</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.877" formerWord="window" newWord="steps" score="0.877">steps</span>, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="surprise" newWord="heartfelt" score="0.672">heartfelt</span> in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.822">ladyship</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="aunt" newWord="mother" score="0.818">mother</span> as made <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.745" formerWord="everything" newWord="everybody" score="0.745">everybody</span> worse. 
<p>Miss Darcy and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="brother" newWord="sister" score="0.842">sister</span> appeared, and this formidable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>introduction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.891" formerWord="introduction" newWord="glory" score="0.891">glory</span> took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.634" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.634">house</span>.

Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="observation" newWord="judgement" score="0.814">judgement</span> of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy.

<p>Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>figure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="figure" newWord="warm" score="0.829">warm</span> was formed, and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>appearance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.844" formerWord="appearance" newWord="residence" score="0.844">residence</span> womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="brother" newWord="sister" score="0.842">sister</span>; but there was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="sense" newWord="fortune" score="0.794">fortune</span> and good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="humour" newWord="humoured" score="0.859">humoured</span> in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>face</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.831" formerWord="face" newWord="eye" score="0.831">eye</span>, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.

<p>They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span> to express her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>satisfaction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="satisfaction" newWord="ignorance" score="0.789">ignorance</span>, and prepare for such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.844" formerWord="visitor" newWord="drawn" score="0.844">drawn</span>, when Bingley's quick <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="step" newWord="falling" score="0.851">falling</span> was heard on the stairs, and in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.659" formerWord="moment" newWord="pemberley" score="0.659">pemberley</span> he entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>.

<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.858">whole</span> before them, indeed, excited a lively <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="attention" newWord="passion" score="0.759">passion</span>. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.856" formerWord="niece" newWord="nieces" score="0.856">nieces</span> directed their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="observation" newWord="judgement" score="0.814">judgement</span> towards each with an earnest though guarded <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inquiry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="inquiry" newWord="information" score="0.756">information</span>; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conviction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="conviction" newWord="discovery" score="0.854">discovery</span> that one of them at least knew what it was to love.

<p>Elizabeth, on her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.673" formerWord="side" newWord="board" score="0.673">board</span>, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="object" newWord="evil" score="0.7">evil</span>, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="success" newWord="usefulness" score="0.817">usefulness</span>, for those to whom she endeavoured to give <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.609" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="share" score="0.609">share</span> were prepossessed in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>favour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.788" formerWord="favour" newWord="situation" score="0.788">situation</span>. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased. 
<p>In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>; and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.709" formerWord="manner" newWord="tone" score="0.709">tone</span>. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.726" formerWord="notion" newWord="shadow" score="0.726">shadow</span> that, as he looked at her, he was trying to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.785" formerWord="trace" newWord="preserve" score="0.785">preserve</span> a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resemblance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="resemblance" newWord="possession" score="0.86">possession</span>.

On this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="point" newWord="subject" score="0.756">subject</span> she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>recollection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="recollection" newWord="chest" score="0.796">chest</span> of Jane not untinctured by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tenderness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.884" formerWord="tenderness" newWord="sweetness" score="0.884">sweetness</span>, and a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.705" formerWord="wish" newWord="preferment" score="0.705">preferment</span> of saying more that might lead to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="mention" newWord="summon" score="0.751">summon</span> of her, had he dared.

<p>Elizabeth was pleased to find his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>memory</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="memory" newWord="glory" score="0.866">glory</span> so exact; and he afterwards took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="occasion" newWord="china" score="0.68">china</span> to ask her, when unattended to by any of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="rest" newWord="nation" score="0.796">nation</span>, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="question" newWord="case" score="0.722">case</span>, nor in the preceding <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>remark</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="remark" newWord="afforded" score="0.789">afforded</span>; but there was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>look</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.6" formerWord="look" newWord="hunt" score="0.6">hunt</span> and a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.709" formerWord="manner" newWord="tone" score="0.709">tone</span> which gave them meaning. 
<p>It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>glimpse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="glimpse" newWord="fever" score="0.859">fever</span>, she saw an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>expression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="expression" newWord="ecstasy" score="0.869">ecstasy</span> of general <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>complaisance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.863" formerWord="complaisance" newWord="languor" score="0.863">languor</span>, and in all that he said she heard an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="accent" newWord="effects" score="0.789">effects</span> so removed from hauteur or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disdain</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="disdain" newWord="professions" score="0.833">professions</span> of his companions, as convinced <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>her</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.826" formerWord="her" newWord="his" score="0.826">his</span> that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>improvement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.907" formerWord="improvement" newWord="becomes" score="0.907">becomes</span> of manners which she had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>yesterday</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.66" formerWord="yesterday" newWord="tea" score="0.66">tea</span> witnessed however temporary its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>existence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.908" formerWord="existence" newWord="pursuit" score="0.908">pursuit</span> might prove, had at least outlived <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.607" formerWord="one" newWord="another" score="0.607">another</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span>.

<p>When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="course" newWord="france" score="0.749">france</span> repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="formality" score="0.864">formality</span> to give.

<p>In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>appearance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.844" formerWord="appearance" newWord="residence" score="0.844">residence</span> before.

<p>Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inclination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.751" formerWord="inclination" newWord="inconsiderable" score="0.751">inconsiderable</span> of replying, she added,"Unhappy as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>event</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.832" formerWord="event" newWord="misery" score="0.832">misery</span> must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lesson</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="lesson" newWord="northampton" score="0.724">northampton</span>: that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>loss</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.862" formerWord="loss" newWord="instance" score="0.862">instance</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>virtue</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="virtue" newWord="travelling" score="0.858">travelling</span> in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>female</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.897" formerWord="female" newWord="flow" score="0.897">flow</span> is irretrievable; that one false <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="step" newWord="falling" score="0.851">falling</span> involves her in endless <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ruin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="ruin" newWord="actions" score="0.845">actions</span>; that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reputation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="reputation" newWord="newspapers" score="0.777">newspapers</span> is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="daughter" score="0.773">daughter</span> towards the undeserving of the other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sex</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="sex" newWord="inconstancy" score="0.823">inconstancy</span>."

<p>"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"

<p>"But not before they went to Brighton?"
<p>"No, I believe not."
<p>"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does he know his real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="character" newWord="sense" score="0.73">sense</span>?"
<p>"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.

<p>"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"
<p>"Perhaps it would have been better,"replied her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>."But to expose the former faults of any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="person" newWord="circumstances" score="0.719">circumstances</span> without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.

<p>"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>note</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.706" formerWord="note" newWord="riding" score="0.706">riding</span> to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.791">son</span>?"
<p>"He brought it with him for us to see."
<p>Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the contents:

<p>"Is it possible?"cried Elizabeth, when she had finished."Can it be possible that he will marry her?"
<p>"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>."My dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.873" formerWord="father" newWord="sister" score="0.873">sister</span>, I congratulate you."

<p>"No; but it must be done soon."

<p>"I dislike it very much,"he replied;"but it must be done."
<p>And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="house" newWord="evening" score="0.749">evening</span>. 
<p>"And may I ask - -"said Elizabeth;"but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."
<p>"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."

<p>"Yes, yes, they must marry.

<p>"That is very true,"said Elizabeth;"though it had not occurred to me before.

<p>"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.605">place</span> off. Must it be so?"
<p>"Oh, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lord</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.526" formerWord="lord" newWord="thomas" score="0.526">thomas</span>! yes; - - there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">something</span> in that.

<p>"I should like it beyond <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.778">anybody</span>!"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span>. 
<p>"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>winter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.844" formerWord="winter" newWord="assembly" score="0.844">assembly</span> is over."

<p>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.

<p>No <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.607" formerWord="one" newWord="another" score="0.607">another</span> but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>stay</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.705" formerWord="stay" newWord="wait" score="0.705">wait</span> would be so short; and she made the most of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span> by visiting about with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="daughter" newWord="conduct" score="0.796">conduct</span>, and having very frequent parties at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="home" newWord="lyme" score="0.707">lyme</span>.

<p>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="occasion" newWord="china" score="0.68">china</span>; no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.607" formerWord="one" newWord="another" score="0.607">another</span> was to be put in competition with him. He did every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.795">body</span> best in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="world" newWord="country" score="0.833">country</span>; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>body</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="body" newWord="thing" score="0.795">thing</span> else in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="country" newWord="world" score="0.833">world</span>. 
<p>One <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.823">day</span>, soon after their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="arrival" newWord="entering" score="0.828">entering</span>, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth: 
<p>"Lizzy, I never gave you an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.618" formerWord="account" newWord="disapprobation" score="0.618">disapprobation</span> of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="wedding" newWord="parade" score="0.783">parade</span>, I believe. You were not by, when I told <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.693" formerWord="mamma" newWord="ma" score="0.693">ma</span> and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"
<p>"No really,"replied Elizabeth;"I think there cannot be too little said on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.756">point</span>."
<p>"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement ' s, because Wickham's lodgings were in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>parish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.879" formerWord="parish" newWord="grounds" score="0.879">grounds</span>. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.822">ladyship</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="aunt" newWord="mother" score="0.818">mother</span> and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>church</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="church" newWord="grants" score="0.875">grants</span>. Well, Monday <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.823">day</span> came, and I was in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fuss</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.863" formerWord="fuss" newWord="persisting" score="0.863">persisting</span>! I was so afraid, you know, that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.716" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.716">anything</span> would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="aunt" newWord="mother" score="0.818">mother</span>, all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span> I was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dressing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.838" formerWord="dressing" newWord="seeking" score="0.838">seeking</span>, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sermon</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.536" formerWord="sermon" newWord="guineas" score="0.536">guineas</span>. However, I did not hear above one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.772">soul</span> in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.743" formerWord="coat" newWord="reduced" score="0.743">reduced</span>."
<p>"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.822">ladyship</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="aunt" newWord="mother" score="0.818">mother</span> were horrid unpleasant all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span> I was with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>foot</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.867" formerWord="foot" newWord="intent" score="0.867">intent</span> out of doors, though I was there a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.732" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="taunton" score="0.732">taunton</span>. Not one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.858">whole</span>, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scheme</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="scheme" newWord="happiest" score="0.86">happiest</span>, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.778">anybody</span>. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.816" formerWord="carriage" newWord="window" score="0.816">window</span> came to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="door" newWord="table" score="0.857">table</span>, my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.822">ladyship</span> was called away upon <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="business" newWord="assembly" score="0.725">assembly</span> to that horrid <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span> Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.703" formerWord="end" newWord="baronet" score="0.703">baronet</span> of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.822">ladyship</span> was to give me away; and if we were beyond the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="hour" newWord="half" score="0.719">half</span>, we could not be married all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span>. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes ' <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span>, and then we all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>set</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="set" newWord="setting" score="0.773">setting</span> out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="wedding" newWord="parade" score="0.783">parade</span> need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."
<p>"Mr. Darcy!"repeated Elizabeth, in utter <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amazement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.77" formerWord="amazement" newWord="dressing" score="0.77">dressing</span>. 
<p>"Oh, yes! - - he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.772">soul</span> about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"
<p>"If it was to be secret,"said Jane,"say not another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.772">soul</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.756">point</span>. You may depend upon my seeking no further."
<p>"Oh! certainly,"said Elizabeth, though <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>burning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="burning" newWord="kiss" score="0.807">kiss</span> with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="patience" score="0.676">patience</span>;"we will ask you no questions."
<p>"Thank you,"said Lydia,"for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."
<p>On such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>encouragement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="encouragement" newWord="throw" score="0.854">throw</span> to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>power</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="power" newWord="situation" score="0.719">situation</span>, by running away.

<p>"MY DEAR NIECE, 
<p>"I have just received your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.648" formerWord="letter" newWord="name" score="0.648">name</span>, and shall devote this whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.823">day</span> to answering it, as I foresee that a little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>writing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.718" formerWord="writing" newWord="motive" score="0.718">motive</span> will not comprise what I have to tell you.

Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.673" formerWord="side" newWord="board" score="0.673">board</span>.

Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.822">ladyship</span> is as much surprised as I am - - and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">something</span> but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>belief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="belief" newWord="impropriety" score="0.904">impropriety</span> of your being a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.858">whole</span> concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit. 
<p>"On the very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span> of my coming <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="home" newWord="lyme" score="0.707">lyme</span> from Longbourn, your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.822">ladyship</span> had a most unexpected <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.844" formerWord="visitor" newWord="drawn" score="0.844">drawn</span>. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.

From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span> after ourselves, and came to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.804">bath</span> with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resolution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.819" formerWord="resolution" newWord="merits" score="0.819">merits</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hunting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.883" formerWord="hunting" newWord="families" score="0.883">families</span> for them. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>motive</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="motive" newWord="difficulty" score="0.781">difficulty</span> professed was his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conviction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="conviction" newWord="discovery" score="0.854">discovery</span> of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.911">man</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="character" newWord="sense" score="0.73">sense</span> to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="pride" newWord="taste" score="0.735">taste</span>, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="world" newWord="country" score="0.833">country</span>. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="character" newWord="sense" score="0.73">sense</span> was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>duty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.745" formerWord="duty" newWord="compliment" score="0.745">compliment</span> to step forward, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>endeavour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.901" formerWord="endeavour" newWord="try" score="0.901">try</span> to remedy an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evil</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="evil" newWord="absolute" score="0.841">absolute</span> which had been brought on by himself. If he had another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>motive</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.781" formerWord="motive" newWord="difficulty" score="0.781">difficulty</span>, I am sure it would never <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disgrace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="disgrace" newWord="maintenance" score="0.794">maintenance</span> him. He had been some days in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.804">bath</span>, before he was able to discover them; but he had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.716" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.716">anything</span> to direct his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>search</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="search" newWord="patron" score="0.791">patron</span>, which was more than we had; and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consciousness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.908" formerWord="consciousness" newWord="judicious" score="0.908">judicious</span> of this was another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.786" formerWord="reason" newWord="objection" score="0.786">objection</span> for his resolving to follow us. 
<p>"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span> ago <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>governess</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.839" formerWord="governess" newWord="beautifully" score="0.839">beautifully</span> to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>charge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.836" formerWord="charge" newWord="transition" score="0.836">transition</span> on some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.871" formerWord="cause" newWord="benefit" score="0.871">benefit</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disapprobation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="disapprobation" newWord="absolute" score="0.791">absolute</span>, though he did not say what. She then took a large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="house" newWord="evening" score="0.749">evening</span> in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="formality" score="0.864">formality</span> of him as soon as he got to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="town" newWord="bath" score="0.804">bath</span>. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trust</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.815" formerWord="trust" newWord="ask" score="0.815">ask</span>, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.792">brother</span> was to be found.

They were in - - - - <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>street</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.739" formerWord="street" newWord="walking" score="0.739">walking</span>. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="object" newWord="evil" score="0.7">evil</span> with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="situation" newWord="health" score="0.796">health</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>return</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.658" formerWord="return" newWord="respects" score="0.658">respects</span> to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assistance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.83" formerWord="assistance" newWord="readiness" score="0.83">readiness</span>, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.685" formerWord="none" newWord="arisen" score="0.685">arisen</span> of her friends; she wanted no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>help</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="help" newWord="bear" score="0.769">bear</span> of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.

Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="marriage" newWord="motives" score="0.777">motives</span>, which, in his very first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.705" formerWord="conversation" newWord="earnestness" score="0.705">earnestness</span> with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="design" newWord="happiness" score="0.747">happiness</span>.

<p>"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span> at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.716" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.716">anything</span> for him, and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="situation" newWord="health" score="0.796">health</span> must have been benefited by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="marriage" newWord="motives" score="0.777">motives</span>.

<p>"On Saturday he came again.

<p>"They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>express</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="express" newWord="rouse" score="0.775">rouse</span> was sent off to Longbourn. But our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.844" formerWord="visitor" newWord="drawn" score="0.844">drawn</span> was very obstinate.

He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">Something</span> was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">something</span> about it ), your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.822">ladyship</span> would most readily have settled the whole. 
<p>"They battled it together for a long <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span>, which was more than either the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.65" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="apricot" score="0.65">apricot</span> or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.822" formerWord="uncle" newWord="ladyship" score="0.822">ladyship</span> was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>use</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.746" formerWord="use" newWord="sacrifice" score="0.746">sacrifice</span> to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.856" formerWord="niece" newWord="nieces" score="0.856">nieces</span>, was forced to put up with only having the probable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>credit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.755" formerWord="credit" newWord="inconvenience" score="0.755">inconvenience</span> of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.648" formerWord="letter" newWord="name" score="0.648">name</span> this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.823">day</span> gave him great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.609" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="share" score="0.609">share</span>, because it required an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>explanation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="explanation" newWord="blindness" score="0.833">blindness</span> that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.804" formerWord="praise" newWord="preference" score="0.804">preference</span> where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most. 
<p>"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>addition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="addition" newWord="phrase" score="0.794">phrase</span> to her own settled upon her, and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>commission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="commission" newWord="preventing" score="0.802">preventing</span> purchased.

<p>"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="wedding" newWord="parade" score="0.783">parade</span> took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.634" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.634">house</span>, and all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.72" formerWord="money" newWord="anybody" score="0.72">anybody</span> matters were then to receive the last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>finish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.752" formerWord="finish" newWord="endure" score="0.752">endure</span>.

<p>"True. Are the others coming out?"

<p>"Yes, she did."

<p>Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.705" formerWord="conversation" newWord="earnestness" score="0.705">earnestness</span> that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span> Elizabeth, by introducing the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="subject" newWord="point" score="0.756">point</span> of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.

<p>"Oh! my dear Lydia,"she cried,"when shall we meet again?"
<p>"Oh, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lord</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.526" formerWord="lord" newWord="thomas" score="0.526">thomas</span>! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps."
<p>"Write to me very often, my dear."
<p>"As often as I can.

<p>Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.791">son</span> ' s. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law."

<p>"I often think,"said she,"that there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">something</span> so bad as parting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."

<p>"It is no such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.795">body</span>.

Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets.

<p>"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>,"( for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>news</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="news" newWord="nation" score="0.784">nation</span> )."Well, so much the better.

But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">something</span> to us.

And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"
<p>"You may depend on it,"replied the other,"for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>night</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="night" newWord="week" score="0.793">week</span>; I saw her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>passing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="passing" newWord="dialogue" score="0.842">dialogue</span> by, and went out myself on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.768" formerWord="purpose" newWord="obey" score="0.768">obey</span> to know the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="truth" newWord="clergy" score="0.772">clergy</span> of it; and she told me that it was certain true.

<p>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.648" formerWord="name" newWord="letter" score="0.648">letter</span> to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said: 
<p>"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="aunt" newWord="mother" score="0.818">mother</span> told us of the present <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>report</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="report" newWord="amount" score="0.875">amount</span>; and I know I appeared distressed.

<p>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.881" formerWord="view" newWord="intercourse" score="0.881">intercourse</span> than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>probability</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.862" formerWord="probability" newWord="complaints" score="0.862">complaints</span> of his coming there with his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.792">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>permission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="permission" newWord="announced" score="0.762">announced</span>, or being bold enough to come without it. 
<p>"Yet it is hard,"she sometimes thought,"that this poor <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span> cannot come to a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.749" formerWord="house" newWord="evening" score="0.749">evening</span> which he has legally hired, without raising all this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speculation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="speculation" newWord="spoilt" score="0.758">spoilt</span>!

<p>His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="wife" newWord="son" score="0.791">son</span> represented to him how absolutely necessary such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="attention" newWord="passion" score="0.759">passion</span> would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.

<p>"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.

<p>He readily agreed to it. 
<p>"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say you meant to quit the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.634" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.634">house</span> entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.87" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="lowest" score="0.87">lowest</span>, since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ' Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet, ' without there being a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>syllable</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="syllable" newWord="error" score="0.776">error</span> said of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.873" formerWord="father" newWord="sister" score="0.873">sister</span>, or the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.634" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.634">house</span> where she lived, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.778">anybody</span>. It was my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.842" formerWord="brother" newWord="sister" score="0.842">sister</span> Gardiner's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>drawing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.876" formerWord="drawing" newWord="pump" score="0.876">pump</span> up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="business" newWord="assembly" score="0.725">assembly</span> of it. Did you see it?"
<p>Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell. 
<p>"It is a delightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="thing" newWord="body" score="0.795">body</span>, to be sure, to have a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="daughter" newWord="conduct" score="0.796">conduct</span> well married,"continued her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span>,"but at the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span>, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.605">place</span> from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.634" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.634">house</span> quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.873" formerWord="regiment" newWord="preceding" score="0.873">preceding</span> is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the - - - - <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="shire" newWord="regiment" score="0.868">regiment</span>, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."
<p>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>misery</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.901" formerWord="misery" newWord="prospect" score="0.901">prospect</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shame</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.897" formerWord="shame" newWord="divisions" score="0.897">divisions</span>, that she could hardly keep her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>seat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.852" formerWord="seat" newWord="chair" score="0.852">chair</span>. It drew from her, however, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>exertion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.873" formerWord="exertion" newWord="exercise" score="0.873">exercise</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="speaking" newWord="talking" score="0.672">talking</span>, which <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">something</span> else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>stay</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.705" formerWord="stay" newWord="wait" score="0.705">wait</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="country" newWord="world" score="0.833">world</span> at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>present</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="present" newWord="least" score="0.675">least</span>. A few weeks, he believed. 
<p>"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span>,"I beg you will come here, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shoot</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="shoot" newWord="rocks" score="0.725">rocks</span> as many as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."
<p>Elizabeth's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>misery</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.901" formerWord="misery" newWord="prospect" score="0.901">prospect</span> increased, at such unnecessary, such officious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="attention" newWord="passion" score="0.759">passion</span>!

At that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>instant</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.748" formerWord="instant" newWord="gate" score="0.748">gate</span>, she felt that years of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="happiness" newWord="conduct" score="0.773">conduct</span> could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="confusion" newWord="flutter" score="0.857">flutter</span>.

<p>Yet the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>misery</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.901" formerWord="misery" newWord="prospect" score="0.901">prospect</span>, for which years of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="happiness" newWord="conduct" score="0.773">conduct</span> were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>material</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.849" formerWord="material" newWord="danger" score="0.849">danger</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="relief" newWord="promote" score="0.829">promote</span>, from observing how much the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.801" formerWord="beauty" newWord="youth" score="0.801">youth</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span> re-kindled the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>admiration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="admiration" newWord="cheerfulness" score="0.847">cheerfulness</span> of her former <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lover</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="lover" newWord="aunts" score="0.846">aunts</span>. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.759" formerWord="attention" newWord="passion" score="0.759">passion</span>. He found her as handsome as she had been last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="year" newWord="week" score="0.817">week</span>; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.

But her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.697" formerWord="mind" newWord="heart" score="0.697">heart</span> was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent. 
<p>When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>civility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="civility" newWord="emotion" score="0.762">emotion</span>, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span>.

<p>Bingley looked a little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silly</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="silly" newWord="tempered" score="0.841">tempered</span> at this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reflection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.8" formerWord="reflection" newWord="embarrassment" score="0.8">embarrassment</span>, and said <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.716" formerWord="something" newWord="anything" score="0.716">anything</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>concern</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="concern" newWord="reluctance" score="0.808">reluctance</span> at having been prevented by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="business" newWord="assembly" score="0.725">assembly</span>. They then went away. 
<p>Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span>; but, though she always kept a very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="table" newWord="window" score="0.868">window</span>, she did not think <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="anything" newWord="anybody" score="0.778">anybody</span> less than two courses could be good enough for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span> on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>appetite</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.882" formerWord="appetite" newWord="start" score="0.882">start</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="pride" newWord="taste" score="0.735">taste</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.607" formerWord="one" newWord="another" score="0.607">another</span> who had ten thousand a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="year" newWord="week" score="0.817">week</span>.

<p>As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interruption</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.79" formerWord="interruption" newWord="stage" score="0.79">stage</span> on those subjects that must deaden them more.

<p>They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="way" newWord="place" score="0.605">place</span> to all the happy schemes, which the good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="humour" newWord="humoured" score="0.859">humoured</span> and common <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>politeness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.832" formerWord="politeness" newWord="ceremonious" score="0.832">ceremonious</span> of Bingley, in half an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="hour" newWord="half" score="0.719">half</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.71" formerWord="visit" newWord="accompany" score="0.71">accompany</span>, had revived.

When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.634" formerWord="place" newWord="house" score="0.634">house</span>, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="sister" newWord="mother" score="0.916">mother</span>. Her prudent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span>, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="round" newWord="door" score="0.823">door</span>, and happened to smile: it was decided.

<p>"If he does not come to me, then,"said she,"I shall give him up for ever."
<p>The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="round" newWord="door" score="0.823">door</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="table" newWord="window" score="0.868">window</span>, where Miss Bennet was making <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.744" formerWord="tea" newWord="breakfast" score="0.744">breakfast</span>, and Elizabeth pouring out the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coffee</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.832" formerWord="coffee" newWord="speeches" score="0.832">speeches</span>, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.863" formerWord="chair" newWord="submission" score="0.863">submission</span>. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whisper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.623" formerWord="whisper" newWord="reply" score="0.623">reply</span>:

<p>Darcy had walked away to another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.763" formerWord="part" newWord="species" score="0.763">species</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>. She followed him with her eyes, envied <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everyone</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.726" formerWord="everyone" newWord="grieving" score="0.726">grieving</span> to whom he spoke, had scarcely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>patience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="patience" newWord="invitations" score="0.793">invitations</span> enough to help <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.812" formerWord="anybody" newWord="myself" score="0.812">myself</span> to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coffee</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.832" formerWord="coffee" newWord="speeches" score="0.832">speeches</span>; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!

<p>She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coffee</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.832" formerWord="coffee" newWord="speeches" score="0.832">speeches</span> cup himself; and she seized the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="indulgence" score="0.806">indulgence</span> of saying:

<p>"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."
<p>"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"
<p>"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."
<p>She could think of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">something</span> more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="success" newWord="usefulness" score="0.817">usefulness</span>.

<p>When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span>'s rapacity for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whist</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.841" formerWord="whist" newWord="foreign" score="0.841">foreign</span> players, and in a few moments after seated with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="rest" newWord="nation" score="0.796">nation</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.858">whole</span>.

<p>Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>supper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="supper" newWord="reaching" score="0.904">reaching</span>; but their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.816" formerWord="carriage" newWord="window" score="0.816">window</span> was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="indulgence" score="0.806">indulgence</span> of detaining them. 
<p>"Well girls,"said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,"What say you to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span>?

Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? ' Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last. ' She did indeed.

<p>Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="daughter" score="0.773">daughter</span> to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.833" formerWord="advantage" newWord="extremity" score="0.833">extremity</span> to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.664" formerWord="family" newWord="children" score="0.664">children</span>, when in a happy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="humour" newWord="humoured" score="0.859">humoured</span>, were so far beyond <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.786" formerWord="reason" newWord="objection" score="0.786">objection</span>, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span>, to make his proposals. 
<p>"It has been a very agreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span>,"said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth."The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="party" newWord="whole" score="0.858">whole</span> seemed so well selected, so suitable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.607" formerWord="one" newWord="another" score="0.607">another</span> with the other. I hope we may often meet again."
<p>Elizabeth smiled. 
<p>"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.

<p>A few days after this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.71" formerWord="visit" newWord="accompany" score="0.71">accompany</span>, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.792">brother</span> had left him that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.823">day</span> for London, but was to return <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="home" newWord="lyme" score="0.707">lyme</span> in ten days <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span>. He sat with them above an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="hour" newWord="half" score="0.719">half</span>, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>concern</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="concern" newWord="reluctance" score="0.808">reluctance</span>, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere. 
<p>"Next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span> you call,"said she,"I hope we shall be more lucky."
<p>He should be particularly happy at any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span>, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.806" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="indulgence" score="0.806">indulgence</span> of waiting on them. 
<p>"Can you come to-morrow?"
<p>Yes, he had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>engagement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.651" formerWord="engagement" newWord="intrusion" score="0.651">intrusion</span> at all for to-morrow; and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="invitation" newWord="apartment" score="0.797">apartment</span> was accepted with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>alacrity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.834" formerWord="alacrity" newWord="remarks" score="0.834">remarks</span>. 
<p>He came, and in such very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span> that the ladies were <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.685" formerWord="none" newWord="arisen" score="0.685">arisen</span> of them dressed.

<p>"We will be down as soon as we can,"said Jane;"but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="half" newWord="hour" score="0.719">hour</span> an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.719" formerWord="hour" newWord="half" score="0.719">half</span> ago."
<p>"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?"
<p>But when her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span> was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters. 
<p>The same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anxiety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.798" formerWord="anxiety" newWord="guest" score="0.798">guest</span> to get them by themselves was visible again in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.801" formerWord="evening" newWord="inn" score="0.801">inn</span>. After <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.744" formerWord="tea" newWord="breakfast" score="0.744">breakfast</span>, Mr. Bennet retired to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>library</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.768" formerWord="library" newWord="hastened" score="0.768">hastened</span>, as was his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>custom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.805" formerWord="custom" newWord="navy" score="0.805">navy</span>, and Mary went up stairs to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>instrument</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.918" formerWord="instrument" newWord="pianoforte" score="0.918">pianoforte</span>. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span>, without making any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="impression" newWord="duties" score="0.851">duties</span> on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said,"What is the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="matter" newWord="case" score="0.735">case</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.693" formerWord="mamma" newWord="ma" score="0.693">ma</span>?

I did not wink at you."She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>waste</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="waste" newWord="brilliancy" score="0.911">brilliancy</span> such a precious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="occasion" newWord="china" score="0.68">china</span>, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,"Come here, my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.577" formerWord="love" newWord="err" score="0.577">err</span>, I want to speak to you,"took her out of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span>. Jane instantly gave a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>look</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.6" formerWord="look" newWord="hunt" score="0.6">hunt</span> at Elizabeth which spoke her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="distress" newWord="maintenance" score="0.762">maintenance</span> at such premeditation, and her entreaty that she would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="door" newWord="table" score="0.857">table</span> and called out: 
<p>"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."
<p>Elizabeth was forced to go. 
<p>"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span>, as soon as she was in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hall</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="hall" newWord="wall" score="0.784">wall</span>."Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room."
<p>Elizabeth made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attempt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.816" formerWord="attempt" newWord="engage" score="0.816">engage</span> to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.786" formerWord="reason" newWord="objection" score="0.786">objection</span> with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span>, but remained quietly in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hall</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="hall" newWord="wall" score="0.784">wall</span>, till she and Kitty were out of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.864" formerWord="sight" newWord="courtship" score="0.864">courtship</span>, then returned into the drawing-room.

<p>After this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="day" newWord="morning" score="0.823">morning</span>, Jane said no more of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indifference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="indifference" newWord="disposition" score="0.803">disposition</span>. Not a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="word" newWord="soul" score="0.772">soul</span> passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>bed</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="bed" newWord="remove" score="0.795">remove</span> in the happy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>belief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="belief" newWord="impropriety" score="0.904">impropriety</span> that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span>.

Elizabeth, who had a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.648" formerWord="letter" newWord="name" score="0.648">name</span> to write, went into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breakfast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.838" formerWord="breakfast" newWord="table" score="0.838">table</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.735" formerWord="room" newWord="pump" score="0.735">pump</span> for that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.768" formerWord="purpose" newWord="obey" score="0.768">obey</span> soon after <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.744" formerWord="tea" newWord="breakfast" score="0.744">breakfast</span>; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.916">sister</span>'s schemes.

<p>"Yes - - that is what makes it amusing.

The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="time" newWord="moment" score="0.606">moment</span> to tell him of their having seen his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="aunt" newWord="mother" score="0.818">mother</span>, of which her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="daughter" newWord="conduct" score="0.796">conduct</span> sat in momentary <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dread</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.923" formerWord="dread" newWord="progress" score="0.923">progress</span>, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>all</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.438" formerWord="all" newWord="present" score="0.438">present</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>walking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="walking" newWord="along" score="0.769">along</span> out.

Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.

<p>"I must ask whether you were surprised?"said Elizabeth. 
<p>"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."
<p>"That is to say, you had given your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>permission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="permission" newWord="announced" score="0.762">announced</span>.

<p>"From the former.

<p>Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.792">brother</span>; so easily guided that his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>worth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.606" formerWord="worth" newWord="natural" score="0.606">natural</span> was invaluable; but she checked herself.

<p>"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! - - engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."
<p>"This is a wretched <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beginning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="beginning" newWord="announced" score="0.777">announced</span> indeed!

<p>Jane looked at her doubtingly."Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him."

<p>"Very, very much. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="something" score="0.707">Something</span> could give either Bingley or myself more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="delight" newWord="dignity" score="0.813">dignity</span>.

Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"
<p>"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all."

<p>"Now I am quite happy,"said she,"for you will be as happy as myself.

But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you."

<p>"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,"said Mrs. Bennet,"to walk to Oakham Mount this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.823" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.823">day</span>.

<p>"It may do very well for the others,"replied Mr. Bingley;"but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.

As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying: 
<p>"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="man" newWord="woman" score="0.911">woman</span> all to yourself.

<p>How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!
