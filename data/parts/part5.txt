<p>With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>return</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="return" newWord="brother" score="0.978">brother</span>.

<p>"I see what you are feeling,"replied Charlotte."You must be surprised, very much surprised - - so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.

In the first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span>, she persisted in disbelieving the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.971">affection</span>; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="match" newWord="period" score="0.653">period</span> might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.921" formerWord="cause" newWord="affection" score="0.921">affection</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mischief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.586" formerWord="mischief" newWord="love" score="0.586">love</span>; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="rest" newWord="nothing" score="0.984">nothing</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">Course</span> could console and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> could appease her.

<p>Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="match" newWord="period" score="0.653">period</span>; but she said less of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>astonishment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.934" formerWord="astonishment" newWord="life" score="0.934">life</span> than of her earnest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="desire" newWord="kindness" score="0.857">kindness</span> for their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.

<p>Mr. Collins's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>return</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="return" newWord="brother" score="0.978">brother</span> into Hertfordshire was no longer a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.971">affection</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to Mrs. Bennet.

It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.

Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> only to the greater <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="distress" newWord="friend" score="0.96">friend</span> of Mr. Bingley's continued <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>absence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.861" formerWord="absence" newWord="minute" score="0.861">minute</span>.

The Netherfield ladies would have had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>difficulty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="difficulty" newWord="home" score="0.903">home</span> in believing that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> who lived by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trade</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.327" formerWord="trade" newWord="avoidance" score="0.327">avoidance</span>, and within <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.379" formerWord="view" newWord="dirt" score="0.379">dirt</span> of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>, and a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>favourite</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.321" formerWord="favourite" newWord="lasting" score="0.321">lasting</span> with all her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Longbourn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="Longbourn" newWord="family" score="0.971">Family</span> nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="regard" newWord="family" score="0.953">family</span>. They had frequently been staying with her in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>. 
<p>The first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> of Mrs. Gardiner's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span> on her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>. Two of her girls had been upon the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, and after all there was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> in it. 
<p>"I do not blame Jane,"she continued,"for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.935">man</span> by this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, had it not been for her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>perverseness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.476" formerWord="perverseness" newWord="look" score="0.476">look</span>.

The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consequence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="consequence" newWord="situation" score="0.903">situation</span> of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span> married before I have, and that the Longbourn <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>estate</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.871" formerWord="estate" newWord="woman" score="0.871">woman</span> is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.97" formerWord="anybody" newWord="way" score="0.97">way</span> else. However, your coming just at this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."
<p>Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="chief" newWord="day" score="0.922">day</span> of this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>news</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="news" newWord="brother" score="0.977">brother</span> had been given before, in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span> of Jane and Elizabeth's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>correspondence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.247" formerWord="correspondence" newWord="entree" score="0.247">entree</span> with her, made her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> a slight <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, and, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="compassion" newWord="family" score="0.961">family</span> to her nieces, turned the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span>. 
<p>When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>."It seems likely to have been a desirable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="match" newWord="period" score="0.653">period</span> for Jane,"said she."I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> with a pretty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> for a few weeks, and when <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accident</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.681" formerWord="accident" newWord="point" score="0.681">point</span> separates them, so easily forgets her, that these <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="sort" newWord="man" score="0.976">man</span> of inconsistencies are very frequent."
<p>"An excellent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consolation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="consolation" newWord="money" score="0.854">money</span> in its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>,"said Elizabeth,"but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accident</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.681" formerWord="accident" newWord="point" score="0.681">point</span>. It does not often happen that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.79" formerWord="interference" newWord="man" score="0.79">man</span> of friends will persuade a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> of independent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> to think no more of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> whom he was violently in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> with only a few days before."
<p>"But that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>expression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="expression" newWord="woman" score="0.795">woman</span> of ' violently in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> ' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="idea" newWord="time" score="0.988">time</span>.

Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley's love?"
<p>"I never saw a more promising <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inclination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="inclination" newWord="mother" score="0.773">mother</span>; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span> he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="dance" newWord="answer" score="0.902">answer</span>; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>.

<p>"Oh, yes! - - of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane!

It had better have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scene</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="scene" newWord="affection" score="0.935">affection</span> might be of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>service</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="service" newWord="time" score="0.851">time</span> - - and perhaps a little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="relief" newWord="expectation" score="0.7">expectation</span> from <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> may be as useful as <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>."
<p>Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proposal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.262" formerWord="proposal" newWord="dream" score="0.262">dream</span>, and felt persuaded of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>'s ready <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquiescence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.239" formerWord="acquiescence" newWord="make" score="0.239">make</span>. 
<p>"I hope,"added Mrs. Gardiner,"that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.913" formerWord="consideration" newWord="affection" score="0.913">affection</span> with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="regard" newWord="family" score="0.953">family</span> to this young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> will influence her.

<p>"And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> of London! My dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, how could you think of it?

<p>"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>? She will not be able to help calling."
<p>"She will drop the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquaintance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="acquaintance" newWord="time" score="0.974">time</span> entirely."

About ten or a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dozen</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.615" formerWord="dozen" newWord="observation" score="0.615">observation</span> years ago, before her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, she had spent a considerable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> in that very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> of Derbyshire to which he belonged.

<p>Mrs. Gardiner's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>caution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.941" formerWord="caution" newWord="anything" score="0.941">anything</span> to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: 
<p>"You are too sensible a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span>, Lizzy, to fall in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>guard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.569" formerWord="guard" newWord="effect" score="0.569">effect</span>. Do not involve yourself or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>endeavour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.539" formerWord="endeavour" newWord="person" score="0.539">person</span> to involve him in an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> which the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="want" newWord="time" score="0.938">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> would make so very imprudent. I have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> to say against him; he is a most interesting young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>; and if he had the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fancy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.949" formerWord="fancy" newWord="family" score="0.949">family</span> run away with you. You have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="sense" newWord="man" score="0.978">man</span>, and we all expect you to use it. Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span> would depend on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resolution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="resolution" newWord="evening" score="0.869">evening</span> and good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conduct</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="conduct" newWord="kind" score="0.943">kind</span>, I am sure. You must not disappoint your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span>."
<p>"My dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, this is being serious indeed."
<p>"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."
<p>"Well, then, you need not be under any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>alarm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="alarm" newWord="sister" score="0.966">sister</span>.

<p>"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."
<p>"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>comparison</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.543" formerWord="comparison" newWord="spirit" score="0.543">spirit</span>, the most agreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> I ever saw - - and if he becomes really attached to me - - I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>imprudence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.333" formerWord="imprudence" newWord="self" score="0.333">self</span> of it. Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy! My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="opinion" newWord="nothing" score="0.977">nothing</span> of me does me the greatest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="honour" newWord="happiness" score="0.986">happiness</span>, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span>, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> that where there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, young people are seldom withheld by immediate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="want" newWord="time" score="0.938">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fellow-creatures</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.311" formerWord="fellow-creatures" newWord="disgust" score="0.311">disgust</span> if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wisdom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.232" formerWord="wisdom" newWord="yarmouth" score="0.232">yarmouth</span> to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hurry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="hurry" newWord="girl" score="0.778">girl</span>. I will not be in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hurry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="hurry" newWord="girl" score="0.778">girl</span> to believe myself his first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span>. When I am in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>company</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="company" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best."
<p>"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> of inviting him."
<p>"As I did the other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>,"said Elizabeth with a conscious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>:"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="account" newWord="family" score="0.992">family</span> that he has been so frequently invited this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span>. You know my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>'s ideas as to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>necessity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="necessity" newWord="happiness" score="0.966">happiness</span> of constant <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>company</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="company" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> for her friends. But really, and upon my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="honour" newWord="happiness" score="0.986">happiness</span>, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied."
<p>Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kindness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="kindness" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span> of her hints, they parted; a wonderful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>instance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.462" formerWord="instance" newWord="minute" score="0.462">minute</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="advice" newWord="part" score="0.766">part</span> being given on such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span>, without being resented. 
<p>Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>abode</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.819" formerWord="abode" newWord="minute" score="0.819">minute</span> with the Lucases, his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> was no great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inconvenience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.912" formerWord="inconvenience" newWord="affection" score="0.912">affection</span> to Mrs. Bennet.

<p>"That you certainly shall."
<p>"And I have another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>favour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="favour" newWord="time" score="0.976">time</span> to ask you. Will you come and see me?"
<p>"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."

<p>Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span>.

<p>She wrote again when the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span> was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley."I did not think Caroline in spirits,"were her words,"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="notice" newWord="her" score="0.937">her</span> of my coming to London.

<p>"If you will only tell me what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="sort" newWord="man" score="0.976">man</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> Miss King is, I shall know what to think."
<p>"She is a very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span>, I believe.

<p>"But he paid her not the smallest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> till her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>grandfather</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.233" formerWord="grandfather" newWord="fan" score="0.233">fan</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>death</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.567" formerWord="death" newWord="minute" score="0.567">minute</span> made her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mistress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="mistress" newWord="woman" score="0.808">woman</span> of this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span>."
<p>"No - - why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because I had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="money" newWord="time" score="0.975">time</span>, what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="occasion" newWord="family" score="0.986">family</span> could there be for making <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> to a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"

If she does not object to it, why should we?"
<p>"Her not objecting does not justify him.

<p>"Well,"cried Elizabeth,"have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish."
<p>"No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose.
