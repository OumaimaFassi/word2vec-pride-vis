She had very little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="notice" newWord="her" score="0.937">her</span> from any but him.

<p>When <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dinner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="dinner" newWord="family" score="0.981">family</span> was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>.

Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added: 
<p>"She has <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span>, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>walker</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.729" formerWord="walker" newWord="company" score="0.729">company</span>.

She really looked almost wild."
<p>"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>countenance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="countenance" newWord="family" score="0.972">family</span>. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="country" newWord="family" score="0.987">family</span>, because her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> had a cold?

<p>"Yes, and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>petticoat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.306" formerWord="petticoat" newWord="separation" score="0.306">separation</span>; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mud</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.314" formerWord="mud" newWord="representation" score="0.314">representation</span>, I am absolutely certain; and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gown</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.658" formerWord="gown" newWord="minute" score="0.658">minute</span> which had been let down to hide it not doing its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>office</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.762" formerWord="office" newWord="sir" score="0.762">sir</span>."

<p>"You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,"said Miss Bingley;"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> make such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>exhibition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.328" formerWord="exhibition" newWord="candle" score="0.328">candle</span>."
<p>"Certainly not."

<p>"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,"observed Miss Bingley in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.769">minute</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whisper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.409" formerWord="whisper" newWord="furniture" score="0.409">furniture</span>,"that this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>adventure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.221" formerWord="adventure" newWord="discouragement" score="0.221">discouragement</span> has rather affected your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>admiration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="admiration" newWord="nothing" score="0.893">nothing</span> of her fine eyes."
<p>"Not at all,"he replied;"they were brightened by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>exercise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.713" formerWord="exercise" newWord="minute" score="0.713">minute</span>."A short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.65" formerWord="pause" newWord="word" score="0.65">word</span> followed this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speech</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.216" formerWord="speech" newWord="destroyer" score="0.216">destroyer</span>, and Mrs. Hurst began again:

<p>"If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,"cried Bingley,"it would not make them one jot less agreeable."
<p>"But it must very materially lessen their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="chance" newWord="time" score="0.924">time</span> of marrying men of any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.913" formerWord="consideration" newWord="affection" score="0.913">affection</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span>,"replied Darcy.

<p>Elizabeth thanked him from her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="heart" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, and then walked towards the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.547" formerWord="table" newWord="morning" score="0.547">morning</span> where a few books were lying.

<p>Elizabeth assured him that she could <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>suit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.883" formerWord="suit" newWord="happiness" score="0.883">happiness</span> herself perfectly with those in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>.

<p>"It ought to be good,"he replied,"it has been the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>work</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="work" newWord="nothing" score="0.955">nothing</span> of many generations."
<p>"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books."
<p>"I cannot comprehend the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neglect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.463" formerWord="neglect" newWord="dance" score="0.463">dance</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>library</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.219" formerWord="library" newWord="associate" score="0.219">associate</span> in such days as these."

<p>"I wish it may."
<p>"But I would really advise you to make your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purchase</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.308" formerWord="purchase" newWord="dining" score="0.308">dining</span> in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.672">duty</span>, and take Pemberley for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>model</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.219" formerWord="model" newWord="hazard" score="0.219">hazard</span>.

<p>"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."
<p>"Upon my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span>, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purchase</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.308" formerWord="purchase" newWord="dining" score="0.308">dining</span> than by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>imitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.274" formerWord="imitation" newWord="slumber" score="0.274">slumber</span>."
<p>Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> for her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="book" newWord="mother" score="0.799">mother</span>; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, to observe the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>game</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.598" formerWord="game" newWord="fortnight" score="0.598">fortnight</span>.

<p>"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>height</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.274" formerWord="height" newWord="fashion" score="0.274">fashion</span>, or rather taller."
<p>"How I long to see her again!

<p>"It is amazing to me,"said Bingley,"how young ladies can have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>patience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="patience" newWord="aunt" score="0.938">aunt</span> to be so very accomplished as they all are."
<p>"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"
<p>"Yes, all of them, I think.

<p>"Nor I, I am sure,"said Miss Bingley. 
<p>"Then,"observed Elizabeth,"you must comprehend a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> in your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="idea" newWord="time" score="0.988">time</span> of an accomplished <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>."

<p>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>injustice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.328" formerWord="injustice" newWord="give" score="0.328">give</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>her</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="her" newWord="affection" score="0.986">affection</span> implied <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="doubt" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span>, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>description</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="description" newWord="wish" score="0.73">wish</span>, when Mr. Hurst called them to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>order</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.91" formerWord="order" newWord="way" score="0.91">way</span>, with bitter complaints of their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inattention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.259" formerWord="inattention" newWord="tongue" score="0.259">tongue</span> to what was going forward.

<p>Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>. 
<p>Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> was worse, and that she could not leave her.

The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>note</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="note" newWord="day" score="0.96">day</span> was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.

Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected. 
<p>"Indeed I have, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="sir" newWord="brother" score="0.967">brother</span>,"was her answer."She is a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> too ill to be moved.

My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, I am sure, will not hear of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>removal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.867" formerWord="removal" newWord="sister" score="0.867">sister</span>."
<p>"You may depend upon it, Madam,"said Miss Bingley, with cold <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>civility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="civility" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>,"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> while she remains with us."
<p>Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. 
<p>"I am sure,"she added,"if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, though with the greatest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>patience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="patience" newWord="aunt" score="0.938">aunt</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span>, which is always the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> with her, for she has, without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>exception</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.259" formerWord="exception" newWord="excellence" score="0.259">excellence</span>, the sweetest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.898" formerWord="temper" newWord="woman" score="0.898">woman</span> I have ever met with.

<p>"Whatever I do is done in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hurry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.778" formerWord="hurry" newWord="girl" score="0.778">girl</span>,"replied he;"and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."
<p>"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,"said Elizabeth. 
<p>"You begin to comprehend me, do you?"cried he, turning towards her. 
<p>"Oh! yes - - I understand you perfectly."
<p>"I wish I might take this for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compliment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="compliment" newWord="day" score="0.89">day</span>; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."
<p>"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> is more or less estimable than such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> as yours."

<p>"Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.579" formerWord="advantage" newWord="minute" score="0.579">minute</span>."
<p>"The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="country" newWord="family" score="0.987">family</span>,"said Darcy,"can in general <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>supply</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.601" formerWord="supply" newWord="attempt" score="0.601">attempt</span> but a few subjects for such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>study</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.544" formerWord="study" newWord="curiosity" score="0.544">curiosity</span>.

<p>"But people themselves alter so much, that there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.854">mind</span> new to be observed in them for ever."
<p>"Yes, indeed,"cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> of mentioning a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="country" newWord="family" score="0.987">family</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.672">duty</span>."I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="country" newWord="family" score="0.987">family</span> as in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>."
<p><span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Everybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.754" formerWord="Everybody" newWord="word" score="0.754">Word</span> was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span>, turned silently away.

<p>"When I am in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="country" newWord="family" score="0.987">family</span>,"he replied,"I never wish to leave it; and when I am in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."
<p>"Aye - - that is because you have the right <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disposition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="disposition" newWord="minute" score="0.799">minute</span>.

<p>"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,"said Elizabeth, blushing for her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>."You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.

<p>"Certainly, my dear, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nobody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="nobody" newWord="family" score="0.938">family</span> said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.672">duty</span>, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.

His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>.

<p>"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>, to arrange with rather more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>precision</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.446" formerWord="precision" newWord="impatient" score="0.446">impatient</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>degree</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="degree" newWord="sister" score="0.982">sister</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>importance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.288" formerWord="importance" newWord="fruit" score="0.288">fruit</span> which is to appertain to this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>request</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="request" newWord="none" score="0.807">none</span>, as well as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>degree</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="degree" newWord="sister" score="0.982">sister</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intimacy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="intimacy" newWord="time" score="0.911">time</span> subsisting between the parties?"
<p>"By all means,"cried Bingley;"let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>height</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.274" formerWord="height" newWord="fashion" score="0.274">fashion</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>size</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="size" newWord="longbourn" score="0.817">longbourn</span>; for that will have more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>weight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.747" formerWord="weight" newWord="sense" score="0.747">sense</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>argument</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="argument" newWord="surprise" score="0.797">surprise</span>, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fellow</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="fellow" newWord="happiness" score="0.784">happiness</span>, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>comparison</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.543" formerWord="comparison" newWord="spirit" score="0.543">spirit</span> with myself, I should not pay him <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.769">minute</span> so much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="deference" newWord="way" score="0.73">way</span>.

<p>Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thought</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.923" formerWord="thought" newWord="life" score="0.923">life</span> she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>laugh</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.578" formerWord="laugh" newWord="horror" score="0.578">horror</span>. Miss Bingley warmly resented the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indignity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.216" formerWord="indignity" newWord="yellow" score="0.216">yellow</span> he had received, in an expostulation with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span> for talking such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nonsense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.721" formerWord="nonsense" newWord="kind" score="0.721">kind</span>. 
<p>"I see your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.428" formerWord="design" newWord="wife" score="0.428">wife</span>, Bingley,"said his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>."You dislike an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>argument</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="argument" newWord="surprise" score="0.797">surprise</span>, and want to silence this."
<p>"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."
