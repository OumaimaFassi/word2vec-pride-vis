<p>It is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="truth" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span> universally acknowledged, that a single <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>possession</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.275" formerWord="possession" newWord="retirement" score="0.275">retirement</span> of a good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span>, must be in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="want" newWord="time" score="0.938">time</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.935">man</span>. 
<p>However little known the feelings or views of such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> may be on his first entering a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.672">duty</span>, this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="truth" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span> is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>property</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.738" formerWord="property" newWord="degree" score="0.738">degree</span> of some one or other of their daughters. 
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet,"said his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.794">husband</span> to him <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>,"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
<p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. 
<p>"But it is,"returned she;"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
<p>Mr. Bennet made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>. 
<p>"Do you not want to know who has taken it?"cried his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.935">man</span> impatiently. 
<p>"You want to tell me, and I have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>objection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.31" formerWord="objection" newWord="sentiment" score="0.31">sentiment</span> to hearing it."
<p>This was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="invitation" newWord="aunt" score="0.96">aunt</span> enough. 
<p>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> of large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>north</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.598" formerWord="north" newWord="nature" score="0.598">nature</span> of England; that he came down on Monday in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chaise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.3" formerWord="chaise" newWord="met" score="0.3">met</span> and four to see the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span>, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>possession</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.275" formerWord="possession" newWord="retirement" score="0.275">retirement</span> before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span> by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="end" newWord="time" score="0.984">time</span> of next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span>."
<p>"What is his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="name" newWord="family" score="0.971">family</span>?"
<p>"Bingley."
<p>"Is he married or single?"
<p>"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> of large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span>; four or five thousand a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span>. What a fine <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> for our girls!"
<p>"How so? How can it affect them?"
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet,"replied his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.935">man</span>,"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
<p>"Is that his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.428" formerWord="design" newWord="wife" score="0.428">wife</span> in settling here?"
<p>"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.428" formerWord="Design" newWord="wife" score="0.428">Wife</span>! <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nonsense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.721" formerWord="Nonsense" newWord="kind" score="0.721">Kind</span>, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
<p>"I see no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="occasion" newWord="family" score="0.986">family</span> for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span>."
<p>"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>share</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.463" formerWord="share" newWord="horror" score="0.463">horror</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="beauty" newWord="family" score="0.976">family</span>, but I do not pretend to be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> extraordinary now. When a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thinking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.609" formerWord="thinking" newWord="duty" score="0.609">duty</span> of her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="beauty" newWord="family" score="0.976">family</span>."
<p>"In such cases, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> has not often much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="beauty" newWord="family" score="0.976">family</span> to think of."
<p>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.672">duty</span>."
<p>"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
<p>"But consider your daughters. Only think what an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>establishment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.476" formerWord="establishment" newWord="satisfaction" score="0.476">satisfaction</span> it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="account" newWord="family" score="0.992">family</span>, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not."
<p>"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="consent" newWord="brother" score="0.967">brother</span> to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span> for my little Lizzy."
<p>"I <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="desire" newWord="kindness" score="0.857">kindness</span> you will do no such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.769">minute</span> so handsome as Jane, nor <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.769">minute</span> so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
<p>"They have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="none" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> of them much to recommend them,"replied he;"they are all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silly</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.546" formerWord="silly" newWord="disposition" score="0.546">disposition</span> and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.854">mind</span> more of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quickness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.692" formerWord="quickness" newWord="horror" score="0.692">horror</span> than her sisters."
<p>"Mr. Bennet, how can you <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>abuse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.234" formerWord="abuse" newWord="vault" score="0.234">vault</span> your own children in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>? You take <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.521" formerWord="delight" newWord="observation" score="0.521">observation</span> in vexing me. You have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="compassion" newWord="family" score="0.961">family</span> for my poor nerves."
<p>"You <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mistake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="mistake" newWord="time" score="0.95">time</span> me, my dear. I have a high <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>respect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="respect" newWord="happiness" score="0.955">happiness</span> for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.913" formerWord="consideration" newWord="affection" score="0.913">affection</span> these last twenty years at least."
<p>"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
<p>"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span> come into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.672">duty</span>."
<p>"It will be no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>use</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.506" formerWord="use" newWord="suffering" score="0.506">suffering</span> to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
<p>"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."
<p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mixture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.612" formerWord="mixture" newWord="gallery" score="0.612">gallery</span> of quick parts, sarcastic <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="humour" newWord="journey" score="0.922">journey</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="reserve" newWord="weather" score="0.387">weather</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>caprice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.472" formerWord="caprice" newWord="minute" score="0.472">minute</span>, that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>experience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="experience" newWord="horror" score="0.783">horror</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>three-and-twenty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.33" formerWord="three-and-twenty" newWord="minute" score="0.33">minute</span> years had been insufficient to make his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.935">man</span> understand his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span>. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="mind" newWord="man" score="0.951">man</span> was less difficult to develop. She was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> of mean <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>understanding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.721" formerWord="understanding" newWord="dinner" score="0.721">dinner</span>, little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>information</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="information" newWord="situation" score="0.86">situation</span>, and uncertain <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.898" formerWord="temper" newWord="woman" score="0.898">woman</span>. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.

<p>Chapter 2 
<p>
<p>Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.935">man</span> that he should not go; and till the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> after the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span> was paid she had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>knowledge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.872" formerWord="knowledge" newWord="pleasure" score="0.872">pleasure</span> of it. It was then disclosed in the following <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>. Observing his second <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span> employed in trimming a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.434" formerWord="hat" newWord="park" score="0.434">park</span>, he suddenly addressed her with: 
<p>"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."
<p>"We are not in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to know what Mr. Bingley likes,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> resentfully,"since we are not to visit."
<p>"But you forget, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="mamma" newWord="friend" score="0.89">friend</span>,"said Elizabeth,"that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."
<p>"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>, and I have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="opinion" newWord="nothing" score="0.977">nothing</span> of her."
<p>"No more have I,"said Mr. Bennet;"and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."
<p>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters. 
<p>"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.79" formerWord="sake" newWord="company" score="0.79">company</span>! Have a little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="compassion" newWord="family" score="0.961">family</span> on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."
<p>"Kitty has no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>discretion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.865" formerWord="discretion" newWord="arrival" score="0.865">arrival</span> in her coughs,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span>;"she times them ill."
<p>"I do not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cough</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.347" formerWord="cough" newWord="stuff" score="0.347">stuff</span> for my own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amusement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.861" formerWord="amusement" newWord="way" score="0.861">way</span>,"replied Kitty fretfully."When is your next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span> to be, Lizzy?"
<p>"To-morrow <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="affection" score="0.961">affection</span>."
<p>"Aye, so it is,"cried her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>,"and Mrs. Long does not come back till the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."
<p>"Then, my dear, you may have the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.579" formerWord="advantage" newWord="minute" score="0.579">minute</span> of your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her."
<p>"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?"
<p>"I <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="honour" newWord="happiness" score="0.986">happiness</span> your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>circumspection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.269" formerWord="circumspection" newWord="acknowledgement" score="0.269">acknowledgement</span>.

Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.794">husband</span>, and spent the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="rest" newWord="nothing" score="0.984">nothing</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>walking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="walking" newWord="sister" score="0.933">sister</span> about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> occasionally to one of his own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span>. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> was decided.

<p>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="dance" newWord="answer" score="0.902">answer</span> for a few minutes, to press his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> to join it.

<p>"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>partner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="partner" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>.

<p>"I would not be so fastidious as you are,"cried Mr. Bingley,"for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kingdom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.413" formerWord="kingdom" newWord="misfortune" score="0.413">misfortune</span>!

<p>"You are dancing with the only handsome <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>,"said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet. 
<p>"Oh! She is the most beautiful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>creature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.779" formerWord="creature" newWord="man" score="0.779">man</span> I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>partner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="partner" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span> to introduce you."
<p>"Which do you mean?"and turning <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="round" newWord="minute" score="0.875">minute</span> he looked for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> at Elizabeth, till catching her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>eye</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.94" formerWord="eye" newWord="appearance" score="0.94">appearance</span>, he withdrew his own and coldly said:"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="humour" newWord="journey" score="0.922">journey</span> at present to give <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consequence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="consequence" newWord="situation" score="0.903">situation</span> to young ladies who are slighted by other men.

<p>Mr. Bingley followed his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="advice" newWord="part" score="0.766">part</span>. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>story</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.838" formerWord="story" newWord="letter" score="0.838">letter</span>, however, with great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>spirit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="spirit" newWord="day" score="0.952">day</span> among her friends; for she had a lively, playful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disposition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="disposition" newWord="minute" score="0.799">minute</span>, which delighted in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> ridiculous. 
<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span> much admired by the Netherfield <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span>. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.

Elizabeth felt Jane's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.672">duty</span>; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span>. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>village</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.894" formerWord="village" newWord="heart" score="0.894">heart</span> where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.

I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> could be like it. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Everybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.754" formerWord="Everybody" newWord="word" score="0.754">Word</span> said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>creature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.779" formerWord="creature" newWord="man" score="0.779">man</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span> that he asked a second <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nobody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="nobody" newWord="family" score="0.938">family</span> can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="dance" newWord="answer" score="0.902">answer</span>. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger - -"
<p>"If he had had any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="compassion" newWord="family" score="0.961">family</span> for me,"cried her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>husband</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="husband" newWord="brother" score="0.981">brother</span> impatiently,"he would not have danced <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.769">minute</span> so much!

<p>"But I can assure you,"she added,"that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> of your set-downs.

<p>When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.948" formerWord="praise" newWord="time" score="0.948">time</span> of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> just how very much she admired him. 
<p>"He is just what a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> ought to be,"said she,"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sensible</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="sensible" newWord="conversation" score="0.799">conversation</span>, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! - - so much ease, with such perfect good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breeding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="breeding" newWord="countenance" score="0.783">countenance</span>!"
<p>"He is also handsome,"replied Elizabeth,"which a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> is thereby complete."
<p>"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>. I did not expect such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compliment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="compliment" newWord="day" score="0.89">day</span>."
<p>"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>difference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="difference" newWord="brother" score="0.976">brother</span> between us.

What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>.

Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.943">time</span>."
<p>"Dear Lizzy!"
<p>"Oh! you are a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> too apt, you know, to like people in general.

<p>"Certainly not - - at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.

<p>Elizabeth listened in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span>, but was not convinced; their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assembly</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.442" formerWord="assembly" newWord="horror" score="0.442">horror</span> had not been calculated to please in general; and with more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quickness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.692" formerWord="quickness" newWord="horror" score="0.692">horror</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="observation" newWord="minute" score="0.851">minute</span> and less pliancy of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.898" formerWord="temper" newWord="woman" score="0.898">woman</span> than her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, and with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judgement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="judgement" newWord="son" score="0.797">son</span> too unassailed by any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.

<p>"Aye - - because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to."
<p>"Miss Bingley told me,"said Jane,"that he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With them he is remarkably agreeable."

<p>"That is very true,"replied Elizabeth,"and I could easily forgive his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="pride" newWord="sister" score="0.973">sister</span>, if he had not mortified <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mine</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.35" formerWord="mine" newWord="companion" score="0.35">companion</span>."

A <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.943">time</span> may be proud without being vain.

<p>The ladies of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Longbourn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="Longbourn" newWord="family" score="0.971">Family</span> soon waited on those of Netherfield.

It was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to be very much in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span>; but she considered with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> that it was not likely to be discovered by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span> in general, since Jane united, with great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>strength</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.925" formerWord="strength" newWord="happiness" score="0.925">happiness</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>feeling</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="feeling" newWord="time" score="0.98">time</span>, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>composure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="composure" newWord="minute" score="0.775">minute</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.898" formerWord="temper" newWord="woman" score="0.898">woman</span> and a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uniform</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.291" formerWord="uniform" newWord="offer" score="0.291">offer</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cheerfulness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.543" formerWord="cheerfulness" newWord="absence" score="0.543">absence</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> Miss Lucas. 
<p>"It may perhaps be pleasant,"replied Charlotte,"to be able to impose on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>public</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="public" newWord="housekeeper" score="0.508">housekeeper</span> in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>; but it is sometimes a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disadvantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.248" formerWord="disadvantage" newWord="security" score="0.248">security</span> to be so very guarded.

There is so much of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gratitude</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="gratitude" newWord="affection" score="0.969">affection</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>vanity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="vanity" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span> in almost every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.685" formerWord="attachment" newWord="deal" score="0.685">deal</span>, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely - - a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="heart" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> enough to be really in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>encouragement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="encouragement" newWord="brother" score="0.955">brother</span>. In nine cases out of ten a women had better <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>show</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.235" formerWord="show" newWord="neglect" score="0.235">neglect</span> more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> than she feels. Bingley likes your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."
<p>"But she does help him on, as much as her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.94" formerWord="nature" newWord="time" score="0.94">time</span> will allow. If I can perceive her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="regard" newWord="family" score="0.953">family</span> for him, he must be a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>simpleton</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.64" formerWord="simpleton" newWord="ease" score="0.64">ease</span>, indeed, not to discover it too."
<p>"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disposition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="disposition" newWord="minute" score="0.799">minute</span> as you do."
<p>"But if a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> is partial to a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, and does not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>endeavour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.539" formerWord="endeavour" newWord="person" score="0.539">person</span> to conceal it, he must find it out."
<p>"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> should be employed in conversing together.

When she is secure of him, there will be more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>leisure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.306" formerWord="leisure" newWord="station" score="0.306">station</span> for falling in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> as much as she chooses."
<p>"Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>plan</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="plan" newWord="pleasure" score="0.793">pleasure</span> is a good one,"replied Elizabeth,"where <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> is in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.963" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.963">time</span> but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="desire" newWord="kindness" score="0.857">kindness</span> of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>husband</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="husband" newWord="brother" score="0.981">brother</span>, or any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>husband</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="husband" newWord="brother" score="0.981">brother</span>, I dare say I should adopt it.

She has known him only a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="affection" score="0.961">affection</span>.

<p>"Not as you represent it.

<p>"Well,"said Charlotte,"I wish Jane <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.888" formerWord="success" newWord="man" score="0.888">man</span> with all my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="heart" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="chance" newWord="time" score="0.924">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> as if she were to be studying his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>twelvemonth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.723" formerWord="twelvemonth" newWord="answer" score="0.723">answer</span>. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="Happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">Brother</span> in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> is entirely a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.971">affection</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="chance" newWord="time" score="0.924">time</span>.

<p>Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span> of some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="interest" newWord="family" score="0.981">family</span> in the eyes of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>.
