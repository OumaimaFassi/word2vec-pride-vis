<p>"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."
<p>Elizabeth was forced to go. 
<p>"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>, as soon as she was in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hall</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.292" formerWord="hall" newWord="pelisse" score="0.292">pelisse</span>."Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dressing-room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="dressing-room" newWord="kind" score="0.868">kind</span>."

<p>Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> were ineffectual.

<p>After this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>, Jane said no more of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indifference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.663" formerWord="indifference" newWord="hope" score="0.663">hope</span>.

Elizabeth, who had a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> to write, went into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breakfast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.727" formerWord="breakfast" newWord="influence" score="0.727">influence</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span> for that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="purpose" newWord="part" score="0.827">part</span> soon after <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.908" formerWord="tea" newWord="time" score="0.908">time</span>; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>'s schemes. 
<p>But on returning to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>drawing-room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.706" formerWord="drawing-room" newWord="room" score="0.706">room</span>, when her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> was finished, she saw, to her infinite <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, there was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span> to fear that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> had been too ingenious for her.

Their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span> was awkward enough; but hers she thought was still worse.

<p>She then hastened away to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>, who had purposely broken up the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>card</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.936" formerWord="card" newWord="brother" score="0.936">brother</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span>, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.

<p>In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="conference" newWord="dancing" score="0.846">dancing</span> with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span> had been short and to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="purpose" newWord="part" score="0.827">part</span>.

<p>Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

<p>"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.

<p>And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ladyship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.907" formerWord="ladyship" newWord="family" score="0.907">family</span> was highly incensed.

<p>"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>creature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.779" formerWord="creature" newWord="man" score="0.779">man</span>; and, for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.79" formerWord="sake" newWord="company" score="0.79">company</span> of giving <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="relief" newWord="expectation" score="0.7">expectation</span> to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours.

<p>"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,"replied Darcy, in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tone</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="tone" newWord="sister" score="0.943">sister</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>emotion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.91" formerWord="emotion" newWord="affection" score="0.91">affection</span>,"that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>light</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.303" formerWord="light" newWord="composure" score="0.303">composure</span>, have given you <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uneasiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.229" formerWord="uneasiness" newWord="disquiet" score="0.229">disquiet</span>. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted."
<p>"You must not blame my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>. Lydia's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thoughtlessness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.479" formerWord="thoughtlessness" newWord="spirit" score="0.479">spirit</span> first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.971">affection</span>; and, of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span>, I could not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="rest" newWord="nothing" score="0.984">nothing</span> till I knew the particulars.

<p>"If you will thank me,"he replied,"let it be for yourself alone.

Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you."
<p>Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span>. After a short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.65" formerWord="pause" newWord="word" score="0.65">word</span>, her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>companion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="companion" newWord="affection" score="0.937">affection</span> added,"You are too generous to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trifle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.862" formerWord="trifle" newWord="friend" score="0.862">friend</span> with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.

<p>Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>awkwardness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.264" formerWord="awkwardness" newWord="disturbance" score="0.264">disturbance</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anxiety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.898" formerWord="anxiety" newWord="life" score="0.898">life</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span>, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>material</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.252" formerWord="material" newWord="landing-place" score="0.252">landing-place</span> a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>change</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="change" newWord="brother" score="0.977">brother</span>, since the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>period</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="period" newWord="sister" score="0.944">sister</span> to which he alluded, as to make her receive with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gratitude</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="gratitude" newWord="affection" score="0.969">affection</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> his present assurances. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="occasion" newWord="family" score="0.986">family</span> as sensibly and as warmly as a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> violently in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>eye</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.94" formerWord="eye" newWord="appearance" score="0.94">appearance</span>, she might have seen how well the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>expression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="expression" newWord="woman" score="0.795">woman</span> of heartfelt <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.521" formerWord="delight" newWord="observation" score="0.521">observation</span>, diffused over his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>face</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.256" formerWord="face" newWord="reproach" score="0.256">reproach</span>, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>importance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.288" formerWord="importance" newWord="fruit" score="0.288">fruit</span> she was to him, made his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> more valuable. 
<p>They walked on, without knowing in what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>direction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.821" formerWord="direction" newWord="friend" score="0.821">friend</span>.

<p>"It taught me to hope,"said he,"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.

<p>Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied,"Yes, you know enough of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>frankness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.361" formerWord="frankness" newWord="poultry" score="0.361">poultry</span> to believe me capable of that.

<p>"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?

<p>"I can easily believe it.

<p>"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."
<p>Darcy mentioned his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>."Did it,"said he,"did it soon make you think better of me?

<p>She explained what its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>effect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="effect" newWord="sister" score="0.961">sister</span> on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.
