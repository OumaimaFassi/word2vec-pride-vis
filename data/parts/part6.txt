<p>"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."

<p>His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span> within <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.379" formerWord="view" newWord="dirt" score="0.379">dirt</span> of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>order</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.91" formerWord="order" newWord="way" score="0.91">way</span> to have the earliest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assurance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.882" formerWord="assurance" newWord="heart" score="0.882">heart</span> of it, and after making his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>bow</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.328" formerWord="bow" newWord="relationship" score="0.328">relationship</span> as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="carriage" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> turned into the Park, hurried <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> with the great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="character" score="0.866">character</span>. On the following <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span> he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>son</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="son" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> Lord - - - -, and, to the great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> of all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span>, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him.

<p>Elizabeth had scarcely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> to disclaim all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>right</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="right" newWord="nothing" score="0.843">nothing</span> to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compliment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="compliment" newWord="day" score="0.89">day</span>, before their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>approach</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.761" formerWord="approach" newWord="country" score="0.761">country</span> was announced by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door-bell</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.473" formerWord="door-bell" newWord="minute" score="0.473">minute</span>, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, was about thirty, not handsome, but in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.943">time</span> and address most truly the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.911">marriage</span>. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire - - paid his compliments, with his usual <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="reserve" newWord="weather" score="0.387">weather</span>, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>, met her with every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>appearance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="appearance" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>composure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.775" formerWord="composure" newWord="minute" score="0.775">minute</span>.

<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> directly with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>readiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="readiness" newWord="engagement" score="0.845">engagement</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ease</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="ease" newWord="friend" score="0.972">friend</span> of a well-bred <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, and talked very pleasantly; but his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="cousin" newWord="happiness" score="0.967">happiness</span>, after having addressed a slight <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="observation" newWord="minute" score="0.851">minute</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>garden</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.586" formerWord="garden" newWord="lock" score="0.586">lock</span> to Mrs. Collins, sat for some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.97" formerWord="anybody" newWord="way" score="0.97">way</span>.

<p>She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consciousness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="consciousness" newWord="horror" score="0.796">horror</span> of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.

<p>Chapter 31 
<p>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="invitation" newWord="aunt" score="0.96">aunt</span> thither - - for while there were visitors in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span>, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span> after the gentlemen's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span>, that they were honoured by such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span>, and then they were merely asked on leaving <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>church</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.488" formerWord="church" newWord="visit" score="0.488">visit</span> to come there in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>. For the last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span> they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span>. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>church</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.488" formerWord="church" newWord="visit" score="0.488">visit</span>. 
<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="invitation" newWord="aunt" score="0.96">aunt</span> was accepted of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span>, and at a proper <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="hour" newWord="mile" score="0.678">mile</span> they joined the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span> in Lady Catherine's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>drawing-room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.706" formerWord="drawing-room" newWord="room" score="0.706">room</span>. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ladyship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.907" formerWord="ladyship" newWord="family" score="0.907">family</span> received them civilly, but it was plain that their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>company</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="company" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> was by no means so acceptable as when she could get <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nobody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="nobody" newWord="family" score="0.938">family</span> else; and she was, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fact</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="fact" newWord="woman" score="0.817">woman</span>, almost engrossed by her nephews, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.943">time</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>. 
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> was a welcome <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="relief" newWord="expectation" score="0.7">expectation</span> to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>, of new books and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>music</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="music" newWord="wish" score="0.909">wish</span>, that Elizabeth had never been <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.769">minute</span> so well entertained in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span> before; and they conversed with so much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>spirit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="spirit" newWord="day" score="0.952">day</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>flow</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.319" formerWord="flow" newWord="horror" score="0.319">horror</span>, as to draw the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>look</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.925" formerWord="look" newWord="nothing" score="0.925">nothing</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span>; and that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ladyship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.907" formerWord="ladyship" newWord="family" score="0.907">family</span>, after a while, shared the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>feeling</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="feeling" newWord="time" score="0.98">time</span>, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out: 
<p>"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is."
<p>"We are <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>music</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="music" newWord="wish" score="0.909">wish</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>madam</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="madam" newWord="year" score="0.702">year</span>,"said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.

<p>Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.948" formerWord="praise" newWord="time" score="0.948">time</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proficiency</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.277" formerWord="proficiency" newWord="quest" score="0.277">quest</span>.

<p>"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>state</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="state" newWord="friend" score="0.972">friend</span> to hear me?

<p>"I shall not say you are mistaken,"he replied,"because you could not really believe me to entertain any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.428" formerWord="design" newWord="wife" score="0.428">wife</span> of alarming you; and I have had the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> of your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquaintance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="acquaintance" newWord="time" score="0.974">time</span> long enough to know that you find great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>enjoyment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="enjoyment" newWord="heart" score="0.922">heart</span> in occasionally professing opinions which in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fact</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="fact" newWord="woman" score="0.817">woman</span> are not your own."
<p>Elizabeth laughed heartily at this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>picture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="picture" newWord="honour" score="0.847">honour</span> of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam,"Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="cousin" newWord="happiness" score="0.967">happiness</span> will give you a very pretty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.314" formerWord="notion" newWord="intermission" score="0.314">intermission</span> of me, and teach you not to believe a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span> I say.

<p>"I am not afraid of you,"said he, smilingly. 
<p>"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,"cried Colonel Fitzwilliam."I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."
<p>"You shall hear then - - but prepare yourself for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.854">mind</span> very dreadful.

<p>"I had not at that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="honour" newWord="happiness" score="0.986">happiness</span> of knowing any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.794">husband</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assembly</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.442" formerWord="assembly" newWord="horror" score="0.442">horror</span> beyond my own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span>."
<p>"True; and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nobody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="nobody" newWord="family" score="0.938">family</span> can ever be introduced in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball-room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.396" formerWord="ball-room" newWord="though" score="0.396">though</span>.

<p>"Perhaps,"said Darcy,"I should have judged better, had I sought an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>introduction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.515" formerWord="introduction" newWord="note" score="0.515">note</span>; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers."

<p>"I can answer your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.963" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.963">time</span>,"said Fitzwilliam,"without applying to him.

<p>"I certainly have not the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>talent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.233" formerWord="talent" newWord="debasement" score="0.233">debasement</span> which some people possess,"said Darcy,"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.

<p>"My fingers,"said Elizabeth,"do not move over this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>instrument</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.595" formerWord="instrument" newWord="case" score="0.595">case</span> in the masterly <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> which I see so many women's do.

<p>Darcy smiled and said,"You are perfectly right. You have employed your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> much better.

We neither of us perform to strangers."
<p>Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy: 
<p>"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.579" formerWord="advantage" newWord="minute" score="0.579">minute</span> of a London <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="master" newWord="town" score="0.818">town</span>.

<p>Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="cousin" newWord="happiness" score="0.967">happiness</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.948" formerWord="praise" newWord="time" score="0.948">time</span>; but neither at that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> nor at any other could she discern any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>symptom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.275" formerWord="symptom" newWord="shop" score="0.275">shop</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span>; and from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> to Miss de Bourgh she derived this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>comfort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.891" formerWord="comfort" newWord="day" score="0.891">day</span> for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.515" formerWord="relation" newWord="park" score="0.515">park</span>.

<p>Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>writing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.631" formerWord="writing" newWord="cause" score="0.631">cause</span> to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span> into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>village</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.894" formerWord="village" newWord="heart" score="0.894">heart</span>, when she was startled by a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ring</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.599" formerWord="ring" newWord="justice" score="0.599">justice</span> at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="door" newWord="time" score="0.979">time</span>, the certain <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>signal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.362" formerWord="signal" newWord="ingenuity" score="0.362">ingenuity</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.408" formerWord="visitor" newWord="attendance" score="0.408">attendance</span>. As she had heard no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="carriage" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span>, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>apprehension</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.572" formerWord="apprehension" newWord="glance" score="0.572">glance</span> was putting away her half-finished <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="door" newWord="time" score="0.979">time</span> opened, and, to her very great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>. 
<p>He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intrusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.248" formerWord="intrusion" newWord="revenge" score="0.248">revenge</span> by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within. 
<p>They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>danger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.945" formerWord="danger" newWord="family" score="0.945">family</span> of sinking into total <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span>. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.854">mind</span>, and in this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>emergence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.274" formerWord="emergence" newWord="square" score="0.274">square</span> recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span> of their hasty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>departure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="departure" newWord="news" score="0.808">news</span>, she observed: 
<p>"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?"
<p>"Perfectly so, I thank you."
<p>She found that she was to receive no other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, and, after a short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.65" formerWord="pause" newWord="word" score="0.65">word</span> added: 
<p>"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="idea" newWord="time" score="0.988">time</span> of ever returning to Netherfield again?"
<p>"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> there in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>future</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="future" newWord="aunt" score="0.943">aunt</span>. He has many friends, and is at a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>life</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="life" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> when friends and engagements are continually increasing."
<p>"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.672">duty</span> that he should give up the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span> so much for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>convenience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.915" formerWord="convenience" newWord="family" score="0.915">family</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.672">duty</span> as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>principle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="principle" newWord="town" score="0.859">town</span>."
<p>"I should not be surprised,"said Darcy,"if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purchase</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.308" formerWord="purchase" newWord="dining" score="0.308">dining</span> offers."
<p>Elizabeth made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>. She was afraid of talking longer of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>; and, having <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> else to say, was now determined to leave the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trouble</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.958" formerWord="trouble" newWord="family" score="0.958">family</span> of finding a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span> to him. 
<p>He took the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hint</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.729" formerWord="hint" newWord="town" score="0.729">town</span>, and soon began with,"This seems a very comfortable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span>. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford."
<p>"I believe she did - - and I am sure she could not have bestowed her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kindness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="kindness" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span> on a more grateful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span>."
<p>"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>choice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.949" formerWord="choice" newWord="happiness" score="0.949">happiness</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.935">man</span>."
<p>"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sensible</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="sensible" newWord="conversation" score="0.799">conversation</span> women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> has an excellent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>understanding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.721" formerWord="understanding" newWord="dinner" score="0.721">dinner</span> - - though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>light</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.303" formerWord="light" newWord="composure" score="0.303">composure</span> it is certainly a very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="match" newWord="period" score="0.653">period</span> for her."
<p>"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.502" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.502">nature</span> of her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> and friends."
<p>"An easy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.502" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.502">nature</span>, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."
<p>"And what is fifty miles of good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>road</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="road" newWord="deal" score="0.796">deal</span>? Little more than half a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>journey</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="journey" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span>. Yes, I call it a very easy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.502" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.502">nature</span>."
<p>"I should never have considered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.502" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.502">nature</span> as one of the advantages of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="match" newWord="period" score="0.653">period</span>,"cried Elizabeth."I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>."
<p>"It is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proof</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.856" formerWord="proof" newWord="nothing" score="0.856">nothing</span> of your own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.685" formerWord="attachment" newWord="deal" score="0.685">deal</span> to Hertfordshire. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="Anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">Time</span> beyond the very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.672">duty</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Longbourn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="Longbourn" newWord="family" score="0.971">Family</span>, I suppose, would appear far."
<p>As he spoke there was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="sort" newWord="man" score="0.976">man</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span> which Elizabeth fancied she <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>understood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.787" formerWord="understood" newWord="life" score="0.787">life</span>; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered: 
<p>"I do not mean to say that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> may not be settled too near her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>. The far and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>near</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="near" newWord="perfection" score="0.387">perfection</span> must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.502" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.502">nature</span> becomes no evil. But that is not the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span> here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>income</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.856" formerWord="income" newWord="time" score="0.856">time</span>, but not such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> as will allow of frequent journeys - - and I am persuaded my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> would not call herself near her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> under less than half the present <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.502" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.502">nature</span>."
<p>Mr. Darcy drew his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="chair" newWord="haste" score="0.793">haste</span> a little towards her, and said,"You cannot have a right to such very strong local <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.685" formerWord="attachment" newWord="deal" score="0.685">deal</span>. You cannot have been always at Longbourn."
<p>Elizabeth looked surprised. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.911">marriage</span> experienced some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>change</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="change" newWord="brother" score="0.977">brother</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>feeling</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="feeling" newWord="time" score="0.98">time</span>; he drew back his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="chair" newWord="haste" score="0.793">haste</span>, took a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>newspaper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.639" formerWord="newspaper" newWord="scene" score="0.639">scene</span> from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.547" formerWord="table" newWord="morning" score="0.547">morning</span>, and glancing over it, said, in a colder <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>voice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="voice" newWord="brother" score="0.984">brother</span>: 
<p>"Are you pleased with Kent?"
<p>A short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dialogue</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.493" formerWord="dialogue" newWord="work" score="0.493">work</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="country" newWord="family" score="0.987">family</span> ensued, on either <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>calm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.318" formerWord="calm" newWord="occupation" score="0.318">occupation</span> and concise - - and soon put an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="end" newWord="time" score="0.984">time</span> to by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>entrance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.915" formerWord="entrance" newWord="week" score="0.915">week</span> of Charlotte and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, just returned from her walk. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tete-a-tete</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.322" formerWord="tete-a-tete" newWord="ingenuity" score="0.322">ingenuity</span> surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mistake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="mistake" newWord="time" score="0.95">time</span> which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.97" formerWord="anybody" newWord="way" score="0.97">way</span>, went away. 
<p>"What can be the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meaning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="meaning" newWord="day" score="0.795">day</span> of this?"said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone."My dear, Eliza, he must be in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>."
<p>But when Elizabeth told of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span>; it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span> to proceed from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>difficulty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="difficulty" newWord="home" score="0.903">home</span> of finding <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> to do, which was the more probable from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span>.

<p>But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>society</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="society" newWord="time" score="0.979">time</span>, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speak</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.339" formerWord="speak" newWord="something" score="0.339">something</span>, it seemed the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>effect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="effect" newWord="sister" score="0.961">sister</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>necessity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="necessity" newWord="happiness" score="0.966">happiness</span> rather than of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>choice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.949" formerWord="choice" newWord="happiness" score="0.949">happiness</span> - - a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sacrifice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.232" formerWord="sacrifice" newWord="g" score="0.232">g</span> to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>propriety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.837" formerWord="propriety" newWord="none" score="0.837">none</span>, not a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to himself.

<p>Chapter 33

<p>More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>park</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="park" newWord="minute" score="0.846">minute</span>, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>perverseness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.476" formerWord="perverseness" newWord="look" score="0.476">look</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mischance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.625" formerWord="mischance" newWord="change" score="0.625">change</span> that should bring him where no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>care</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="care" newWord="affection" score="0.903">affection</span> to inform him at first that it was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>favourite</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.321" formerWord="favourite" newWord="lasting" score="0.321">lasting</span> haunt of hers. How it could occur a second <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third.

He never said a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, nor did she give herself the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trouble</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.958" formerWord="trouble" newWord="family" score="0.958">family</span> of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span> of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions - - about her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> in being at Hunsford, her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> of solitary walks, and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="opinion" newWord="nothing" score="0.977">nothing</span> of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>; and that in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span>, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>, he must mean an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>allusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.332" formerWord="allusion" newWord="haste" score="0.332">haste</span> to what might arise in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quarter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.24" formerWord="quarter" newWord="taste" score="0.24">taste</span>.

<p>She was engaged one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> as she walked, in perusing Jane's last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dwelling</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.786" formerWord="dwelling" newWord="family" score="0.786">family</span> on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> immediately and forcing a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>, she said:

<p>And accordingly she did <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>turn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.281" formerWord="turn" newWord="control" score="0.281">control</span>, and they walked towards the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Parsonage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.224" formerWord="Parsonage" newWord="villain" score="0.224">Villain</span> together. 
<p>"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?"said she. 
<p>"Yes - - if Darcy does not put it off again.

It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly.

<p>"No,"said Colonel Fitzwilliam,"that is an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.579" formerWord="advantage" newWord="minute" score="0.579">minute</span> which he must divide with me.

<p>As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uneasiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.229" formerWord="uneasiness" newWord="disquiet" score="0.229">disquiet</span>, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="truth" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span>. She directly replied:

<p>"Oh! yes,"said Elizabeth <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>drily</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.293" formerWord="drily" newWord="midst" score="0.293">midst</span>;"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>care</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="care" newWord="affection" score="0.903">affection</span> of him."
<p>"Care of him!

But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.943">time</span> meant.

<p>"What is it you mean?"
<p>"It is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>circumstance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="circumstance" newWord="thing" score="0.973">thing</span> which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="round" newWord="minute" score="0.875">minute</span> to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.794">husband</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, it would be an unpleasant <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>."
<p>"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."
<p>"And remember that I have not much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span> for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> from the inconveniences of a most imprudent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> of young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> to get into a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scrape</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.524" formerWord="scrape" newWord="difference" score="0.524">difference</span> of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="sort" newWord="man" score="0.976">man</span>, and from knowing them to have been together the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>summer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.271" formerWord="summer" newWord="exposure" score="0.271">exposure</span>."
<p>"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.79" formerWord="interference" newWord="man" score="0.79">man</span>?"
<p>"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.794">husband</span>."
<p>"And what arts did he use to separate them?"
<p>"He did not talk to me of his own arts,"said Fitzwilliam, smiling."He only told me what I have now told you."
<p>Elizabeth made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, and walked on, her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="heart" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> swelling with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indignation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.908" formerWord="indignation" newWord="anything" score="0.908">anything</span>. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful. 
<p>"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,"said she."Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="cousin" newWord="happiness" score="0.967">happiness</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conduct</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="conduct" newWord="kind" score="0.943">kind</span> does not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>suit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.883" formerWord="suit" newWord="happiness" score="0.883">happiness</span> my feelings.

<p>"You are rather disposed to call his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.79" formerWord="interference" newWord="man" score="0.79">man</span> officious?"
<p>"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>propriety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.837" formerWord="propriety" newWord="none" score="0.837">none</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inclination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="inclination" newWord="mother" score="0.773">mother</span>, or why, upon his own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judgement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="judgement" newWord="son" score="0.797">son</span> alone, he was to determine and direct in what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> was to be happy. But,"she continued, recollecting herself,"as we know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="none" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.

<p>"That is not an unnatural surmise,"said Fitzwilliam,"but it is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lessening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.42" formerWord="lessening" newWord="readiness" score="0.42">readiness</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="honour" newWord="happiness" score="0.986">happiness</span> of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="cousin" newWord="happiness" score="0.967">happiness</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>triumph</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.283" formerWord="triumph" newWord="self-denying" score="0.283">self-denying</span> very sadly."
<p>This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>picture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="picture" newWord="honour" score="0.847">honour</span> of Mr. Darcy, that she would not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trust</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="trust" newWord="man" score="0.916">man</span> herself with an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, and therefore, abruptly changing the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage.

That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.428" formerWord="design" newWord="wife" score="0.428">wife</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrangement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.715" formerWord="arrangement" newWord="note" score="0.715">note</span> of them.

<p>When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>employment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="employment" newWord="answer" score="0.917">answer</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>examination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.227" formerWord="examination" newWord="copse" score="0.227">copse</span> of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent.

<p>While settling this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span>, she was suddenly roused by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sound</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.727" formerWord="sound" newWord="object" score="0.727">object</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door-bell</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.473" formerWord="door-bell" newWord="minute" score="0.473">minute</span>, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="idea" newWord="time" score="0.988">time</span> of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.

<p>"And of your infliction,"cried Elizabeth with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>energy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.335" formerWord="energy" newWord="good" score="0.335">good</span>."You have reduced him to his present <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>state</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="state" newWord="friend" score="0.972">friend</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>poverty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.237" formerWord="poverty" newWord="stain" score="0.237">stain</span> - - comparative <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>poverty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.237" formerWord="poverty" newWord="stain" score="0.237">stain</span>.

<p>"And this,"cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>,"is your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="opinion" newWord="nothing" score="0.977">nothing</span> of me!
