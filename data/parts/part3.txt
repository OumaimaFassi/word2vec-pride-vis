<p>Mr. Darcy took her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.766" formerWord="advice" newWord="part" score="0.766">part</span>, and did finish his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>. 
<p>When that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span> was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indulgence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.429" formerWord="indulgence" newWord="error" score="0.429">error</span> of some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>music</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="music" newWord="wish" score="0.909">wish</span>. Miss Bingley moved with some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>alacrity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="alacrity" newWord="acquaintance" score="0.814">acquaintance</span> to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pianoforte</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="pianoforte" newWord="day" score="0.859">day</span>; and, after a polite <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>request</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="request" newWord="none" score="0.807">none</span> that Elizabeth would lead the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself. 
<p>Mrs. Hurst sang with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>instrument</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.595" formerWord="instrument" newWord="case" score="0.595">case</span>, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>admiration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="admiration" newWord="nothing" score="0.893">nothing</span> to so great a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="notice" newWord="her" score="0.937">her</span> because there was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.854">mind</span> more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>right</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="right" newWord="nothing" score="0.843">nothing</span>, than in any other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.943">time</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>present</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="present" newWord="brother" score="0.959">brother</span>.

<p>After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>charm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.891" formerWord="charm" newWord="sister" score="0.891">sister</span> by a lively Scotch <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>air</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.5" formerWord="air" newWord="sea" score="0.5">sea</span>; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her: 
<p>"Do not you feel a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inclination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="inclination" newWord="mother" score="0.773">mother</span>, Miss Bennet, to seize such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of dancing a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reel</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.318" formerWord="reel" newWord="fable" score="0.318">fable</span>?"
<p>She smiled, but made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>. He repeated the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.963" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.963">time</span>, with some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> at her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span>. 
<p>"Oh!"said she,"I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.

I have, therefore, made up my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="mind" newWord="man" score="0.951">man</span> to tell you, that I do not want to dance a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reel</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.318" formerWord="reel" newWord="fable" score="0.318">fable</span> at all - - and now despise me if you dare."
<p>"Indeed I do not dare."
<p>Elizabeth, having rather expected to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affront</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.638" formerWord="affront" newWord="person" score="0.638">person</span> him, was amazed at his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gallantry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.885" formerWord="gallantry" newWord="end" score="0.885">end</span>; but there was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mixture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.612" formerWord="mixture" newWord="gallery" score="0.612">gallery</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sweetness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="sweetness" newWord="minute" score="0.803">minute</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>archness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.377" formerWord="archness" newWord="step" score="0.377">step</span> in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> which made it difficult for her to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affront</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.638" formerWord="affront" newWord="person" score="0.638">person</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.97" formerWord="anybody" newWord="way" score="0.97">way</span>; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> as he was by her.

<p>Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anxiety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.898" formerWord="anxiety" newWord="life" score="0.898">life</span> for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>recovery</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="recovery" newWord="character" score="0.803">character</span> of her dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> Jane received some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assistance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.415" formerWord="assistance" newWord="barouche" score="0.415">barouche</span> from her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="desire" newWord="kindness" score="0.857">kindness</span> of getting rid of Elizabeth. 
<p>She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>guest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.351" formerWord="guest" newWord="mode" score="0.351">mode</span>, by talking of their supposed <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, and planning his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> in such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>alliance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="alliance" newWord="aunt" score="0.784">aunt</span>.

<p>At that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> they were met from another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>walk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="walk" newWord="friend" score="0.978">friend</span> by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself. 
<p>"I did not know that you intended to walk,"said Miss Bingley, in some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.349" formerWord="confusion" newWord="curiosity" score="0.349">curiosity</span>, lest they had been overheard.

<p>Then taking the disengaged <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="arm" newWord="happiness" score="0.974">happiness</span> of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>path</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.711" formerWord="path" newWord="matter" score="0.711">matter</span> just admitted three.

<p>But Elizabeth, who had not the least <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inclination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="inclination" newWord="mother" score="0.773">mother</span> to remain with them, laughingly answered:

<p>When the ladies removed after <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dinner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="dinner" newWord="family" score="0.981">family</span>, Elizabeth ran up to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>drawing-room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.706" formerWord="drawing-room" newWord="room" score="0.706">room</span>, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="hour" newWord="mile" score="0.678">mile</span> which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> were considerable.

He was full of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>joy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="joy" newWord="brother" score="0.955">brother</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span>. The first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half-hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.532" formerWord="half-hour" newWord="partner" score="0.532">partner</span> was spent in piling up the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.244" formerWord="fire" newWord="self" score="0.244">self</span>, lest she should suffer from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>change</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="change" newWord="brother" score="0.977">brother</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>; and she removed at his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="desire" newWord="kindness" score="0.857">kindness</span> to the other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fireplace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.316" formerWord="fireplace" newWord="water" score="0.316">water</span>, that she might be further from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="door" newWord="time" score="0.979">time</span>.

<p>When <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.908" formerWord="tea" newWord="time" score="0.908">time</span> was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister-in-law</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.297" formerWord="sister-in-law" newWord="stranger" score="0.297">stranger</span> of the card-table - - but in vain.

She assured him that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> intended to play, and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span> of the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span> seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="book" newWord="mother" score="0.799">mother</span>; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> with Miss Bennet. 
<p>Miss Bingley's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>progress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.774" formerWord="progress" newWord="heart" score="0.774">heart</span> through his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="book" newWord="mother" score="0.799">mother</span>, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inquiry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.681" formerWord="inquiry" newWord="house" score="0.681">house</span>, or looking at his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>page</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.521" formerWord="page" newWord="chance" score="0.521">chance</span>. She could not win him, however, to any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span>; he merely answered her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.963" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.963">time</span>, and read on.

<p>No <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="book" newWord="mother" score="0.799">mother</span>, and cast her eyes round the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span> in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.468" formerWord="quest" newWord="behaviour" score="0.468">behaviour</span> for some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amusement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.861" formerWord="amusement" newWord="way" score="0.861">way</span>; when hearing her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span> mentioning a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span> to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said: 
<p>"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="dance" newWord="answer" score="0.902">answer</span> at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span>; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span> would be rather a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>punishment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.435" formerWord="punishment" newWord="promise" score="0.435">promise</span> than a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>."
<p>"If you mean Darcy,"cried her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span>,"he may go to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>bed</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.249" formerWord="bed" newWord="whip" score="0.249">whip</span>, if he chooses, before it begins - - but as for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span>, it is quite a settled <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>; and as soon as Nicholls has made white <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>soup</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.458" formerWord="soup" newWord="cause" score="0.458">cause</span> enough, I shall send <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="round" newWord="minute" score="0.875">minute</span> my cards."
<p>"I should like balls infinitely better,"she replied,"if they were carried on in a different <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>; but there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.854">mind</span> insufferably tedious in the usual <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>process</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.245" formerWord="process" newWord="mine" score="0.245">mine</span> of such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meeting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="meeting" newWord="family" score="0.937">family</span>. It would surely be much more rational if <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> instead of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dancing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="dancing" newWord="brother" score="0.962">brother</span> were made the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>order</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.91" formerWord="order" newWord="way" score="0.91">way</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>."
<p>"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span>."
<p>Miss Bingley made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>figure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="figure" newWord="week" score="0.859">week</span> was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desperation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.259" formerWord="desperation" newWord="principal" score="0.259">principal</span> of her feelings, she resolved on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>effort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.24" formerWord="effort" newWord="excursion" score="0.24">excursion</span> more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said: 
<p>"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>example</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.337" formerWord="example" newWord="rumour" score="0.337">rumour</span>, and take a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>turn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.281" formerWord="turn" newWord="control" score="0.281">control</span> about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>.

<p>Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>civility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="civility" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>awake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.249" formerWord="awake" newWord="ridge" score="0.249">ridge</span> to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>novelty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.835" formerWord="novelty" newWord="way" score="0.835">way</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quarter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.24" formerWord="quarter" newWord="taste" score="0.24">taste</span> as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="book" newWord="mother" score="0.799">mother</span>. He was directly invited to join their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span>, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span> together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere."What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meaning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="meaning" newWord="day" score="0.795">day</span>?"- - and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him? 
<p>"Not at all,"was her answer;"but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> of disappointing him will be to ask <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> about it."
<p>Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>, and persevered therefore in requiring an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>explanation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.92" formerWord="explanation" newWord="mother" score="0.92">mother</span> of his two motives. 
<p>"I have not the smallest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>objection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.31" formerWord="objection" newWord="sentiment" score="0.31">sentiment</span> to explaining them,"said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak."You either choose this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>method</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.298" formerWord="method" newWord="field" score="0.298">field</span> of passing the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> because you are in each other's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confidence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.878" formerWord="confidence" newWord="heart" score="0.878">heart</span>, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.579" formerWord="advantage" newWord="minute" score="0.579">minute</span> in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>walking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="walking" newWord="sister" score="0.933">sister</span>; if the first, I would be completely in your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.244" formerWord="fire" newWord="self" score="0.244">self</span>."

Mrs. Bennet sent them <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span> that they could not possibly have the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="carriage" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> before Tuesday; and in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>postscript</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.611" formerWord="postscript" newWord="nobody" score="0.611">nobody</span> it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.

<p>Elizabeth could not but look surprised. 
<p>"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assertion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.639" formerWord="assertion" newWord="situation" score="0.639">situation</span>, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> of our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meeting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="meeting" newWord="family" score="0.937">family</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>yesterday</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="yesterday" newWord="family" score="0.967">family</span>.

<p>"As much as I ever wish to be,"cried Elizabeth very warmly."I have spent four days in the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span> with him, and I think him very disagreeable."
<p>"I have no right to give my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="opinion" newWord="nothing" score="0.977">nothing</span>,"said Wickham,"as to his being agreeable or otherwise.

<p>"Oh! no - - it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go.
