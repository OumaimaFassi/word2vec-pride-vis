Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no."
<p>"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>history</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="history" newWord="family" score="0.847">family</span> of himself as he gave me last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>night</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.946" formerWord="night" newWord="life" score="0.946">life</span>; names, facts, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="everything" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> mentioned without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ceremony</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.539" formerWord="ceremony" newWord="curiosity" score="0.539">curiosity</span>.

<p>"I beg your pardon; <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> knows exactly what to think."
<p>But Jane could think with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>certainty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="certainty" newWord="family" score="0.847">family</span> on only one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span> - - that Mr. Bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.942" formerWord="affair" newWord="friend" score="0.942">friend</span> became public.

<p>"I do not think we were speaking at all.

<p>"What think you of books?"said he, smiling. 
<p>"Books - - oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."
<p>"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>, there can at least be no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="want" newWord="time" score="0.938">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>.

<p>"Yes, always,"she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming,"I remember <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hearing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.956" formerWord="hearing" newWord="time" score="0.956">time</span> you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resentment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="resentment" newWord="papa" score="0.387">papa</span> once created was unappeasable.

Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> quite forgot to tell you, among his other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>communication</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.931" formerWord="communication" newWord="friend" score="0.931">friend</span>, that he was the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>son</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="son" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span> of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>steward</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.85" formerWord="steward" newWord="sister" score="0.85">sister</span>. Let me recommend you, however, as a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>, not to give implicit <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confidence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.878" formerWord="confidence" newWord="heart" score="0.878">heart</span> to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ill</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="ill" newWord="son" score="0.951">son</span>, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span> thought that he could not well avoid including him in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="invitation" newWord="aunt" score="0.96">aunt</span> to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>. His coming into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="country" newWord="family" score="0.987">family</span> at all is a most insolent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.

<p>After <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breakfast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.727" formerWord="breakfast" newWord="influence" score="0.727">influence</span>, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lament</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.295" formerWord="lament" newWord="downstairs" score="0.295">downstairs</span> over his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>absence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.861" formerWord="absence" newWord="minute" score="0.861">minute</span> from the Netherfield <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span>.

<p>Soon after their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>return</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="return" newWord="brother" score="0.978">brother</span>, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield.

When they had gained their own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>, Jane, taking out the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, said:

<p>"You must decide for yourself,"said Elizabeth;"and if, upon <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.261" formerWord="mature" newWord="fortitude" score="0.261">fortitude</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deliberation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.431" formerWord="deliberation" newWord="choice" score="0.431">choice</span>, you find that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>misery</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="misery" newWord="time" score="0.917">time</span> of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> of being his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.935">man</span>, I advise you by all means to refuse him."
<p>"How can you talk so?"said Jane, faintly smiling."You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disapprobation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.265" formerWord="disapprobation" newWord="volume" score="0.265">volume</span>, I could not hesitate."
<p>"I did not think you would; and that being the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>, I cannot consider your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span> with much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="compassion" newWord="family" score="0.961">family</span>."
<p>"But if he returns no more this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>winter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.483" formerWord="winter" newWord="mind" score="0.483">mind</span>, my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>choice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.949" formerWord="choice" newWord="happiness" score="0.949">happiness</span> will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"
<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="idea" newWord="time" score="0.988">time</span> of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>contempt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="contempt" newWord="return" score="0.725">return</span>. It appeared to her merely the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>suggestion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.406" formerWord="suggestion" newWord="gratitude" score="0.406">gratitude</span> of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> so totally independent of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everyone</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.393" formerWord="everyone" newWord="value" score="0.393">value</span>. 
<p>She represented to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> as forcibly as possible what she felt on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>, and had soon the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> of seeing its happy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>effect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="effect" newWord="sister" score="0.961">sister</span>. Jane's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.898" formerWord="temper" newWord="woman" score="0.898">woman</span> was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>diffidence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.323" formerWord="diffidence" newWord="act" score="0.323">act</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> sometimes overcame the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hope</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="hope" newWord="day" score="0.972">day</span>, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="wish" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="heart" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>. 
<p>They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>departure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="departure" newWord="news" score="0.808">news</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, without being alarmed on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>score</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.395" formerWord="score" newWord="poetry" score="0.395">poetry</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.911">marriage</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conduct</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="conduct" newWord="kind" score="0.943">kind</span>; but even this partial <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>communication</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.931" formerWord="communication" newWord="friend" score="0.931">friend</span> gave her a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>concern</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.862" formerWord="concern" newWord="sister" score="0.862">sister</span>, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>length</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="length" newWord="everything" score="0.967">everything</span>, she had the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consolation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="consolation" newWord="money" score="0.854">money</span> that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conclusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="conclusion" newWord="happiness" score="0.903">happiness</span> of all was the comfortable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>declaration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.358" formerWord="declaration" newWord="indignation" score="0.358">indignation</span>, that though he had been invited only to a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dinner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="dinner" newWord="family" score="0.981">family</span>, she would take <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>care</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="care" newWord="affection" score="0.903">affection</span> to have two full courses.
