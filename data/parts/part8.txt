<p>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="niece" newWord="love" score="0.854">love</span> with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>, but Elizabeth could not return it.

<p>Mrs. Reynolds <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>respect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="respect" newWord="happiness" score="0.955">happiness</span> for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intimation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.216" formerWord="intimation" newWord="woody" score="0.216">woody</span> of her knowing her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="master" newWord="town" score="0.818">town</span>. 
<p>"Does that young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.794">husband</span> know Mr. Darcy?"
<p>Elizabeth coloured, and said:"A little."
<p>"And do not you think him a very handsome <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.911">marriage</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ma'am</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="ma'am" newWord="family" score="0.966">family</span>?"
<p>"Yes, very handsome."
<p>"I am sure I know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="none" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> so handsome; but in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gallery</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.928" formerWord="gallery" newWord="pleasure" score="0.928">pleasure</span> up stairs you will see a finer, larger <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>picture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="picture" newWord="honour" score="0.847">honour</span> of him than this.

He was very fond of them."
<p>This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them. 
<p>Mrs. Reynolds then directed their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old. 
<p>"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span>?"said Mrs. Gardiner. 
<p>"Oh! yes - - the handsomest young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.794">husband</span> that ever was seen; and so accomplished! - - She plays and sings all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> long.

<p>Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="pride" newWord="sister" score="0.973">sister</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.685" formerWord="attachment" newWord="deal" score="0.685">deal</span>, had evidently great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> in talking of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="master" newWord="town" score="0.818">town</span> and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>. 
<p>"Is your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="master" newWord="town" score="0.818">town</span> much at Pemberley in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span>?"
<p>"Not so much as I could wish, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="sir" newWord="brother" score="0.967">brother</span>; but I dare say he may spend <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.769">minute</span> his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>summer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.271" formerWord="summer" newWord="exposure" score="0.271">exposure</span> months."
<p>"Except,"thought Elizabeth,"when she goes to Ramsgate."
<p>"If your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="master" newWord="town" score="0.818">town</span> would marry, you might see more of him."
<p>"Yes, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="sir" newWord="brother" score="0.967">brother</span>; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him."
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying,"It is very much to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>credit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.819" formerWord="credit" newWord="love" score="0.819">love</span>, I am sure, that you should think so."
<p>"I say no more than the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="truth" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.754" formerWord="everybody" newWord="word" score="0.754">word</span> will say that knows him,"replied the other.

<p>This was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.948" formerWord="praise" newWord="time" score="0.948">time</span>, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.

<p>"Yes, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="sir" newWord="brother" score="0.967">brother</span>, I know I am.

But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>boy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.384" formerWord="boy" newWord="firmness" score="0.384">firmness</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span>."
<p>Elizabeth almost stared at her."Can this be Mr. Darcy?"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thought</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.923" formerWord="thought" newWord="life" score="0.923">life</span> she. 
<p>"His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span> was an excellent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>,"said Mrs. Gardiner.

<p>Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impatient</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.742" formerWord="impatient" newWord="news" score="0.742">news</span> for more.

<p>Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span>. 
<p>"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,"replied her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span>."Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span>, as he might change his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="mind" newWord="man" score="0.951">man</span> another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>, and warn me off his grounds."
<p>Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span>, but said <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span>. 
<p>"From what we have seen of him,"continued Mrs. Gardiner,"I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.97" formerWord="anybody" newWord="way" score="0.97">way</span> as he has done by poor Wickham.

I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.

<p>Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> to visit her the very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.307" formerWord="sight" newWord="pleasanter" score="0.307">pleasanter</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.497" formerWord="inn" newWord="enjoyment" score="0.497">enjoyment</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span>.

<p>Miss Darcy and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span> appeared, and this formidable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>introduction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.515" formerWord="introduction" newWord="note" score="0.515">note</span> took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span>.

Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="observation" newWord="minute" score="0.851">minute</span> of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy.

She was less handsome than her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span>; but there was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="sense" newWord="man" score="0.978">man</span> and good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="humour" newWord="journey" score="0.922">journey</span> in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>face</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.256" formerWord="face" newWord="reproach" score="0.256">reproach</span>, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.

<p>They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> to express her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>satisfaction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.945" formerWord="satisfaction" newWord="affection" score="0.945">affection</span>, and prepare for such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.408" formerWord="visitor" newWord="attendance" score="0.408">attendance</span>, when Bingley's quick <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="step" newWord="round" score="0.725">round</span> was heard on the stairs, and in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> he entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>. All Elizabeth's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.957" formerWord="anger" newWord="friend" score="0.957">friend</span> against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ground</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.276" formerWord="ground" newWord="slope" score="0.276">slope</span> against the unaffected <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cordiality</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.479" formerWord="cordiality" newWord="impression" score="0.479">impression</span> with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though general <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, after her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done. 
<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>personage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.366" formerWord="personage" newWord="evenness" score="0.366">evenness</span> than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span> before them, indeed, excited a lively <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span>. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="niece" newWord="love" score="0.854">love</span> directed their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="observation" newWord="minute" score="0.851">minute</span> towards each with an earnest though guarded <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inquiry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.681" formerWord="inquiry" newWord="house" score="0.681">house</span>; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conviction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.963" formerWord="conviction" newWord="friend" score="0.963">friend</span> that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.794">husband</span>'s sensations they remained a little in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="doubt" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span>; but that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.911">marriage</span> was overflowing with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>admiration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="admiration" newWord="nothing" score="0.893">nothing</span> was evident enough. 
<p>Elizabeth, on her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span>, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.888" formerWord="success" newWord="man" score="0.888">man</span>, for those to whom she endeavoured to give <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> were prepossessed in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>favour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="favour" newWord="time" score="0.976">time</span>. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased. 
<p>In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>; and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.314" formerWord="notion" newWord="intermission" score="0.314">intermission</span> that, as he looked at her, he was trying to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.652" formerWord="trace" newWord="minute" score="0.652">minute</span> a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resemblance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.727" formerWord="resemblance" newWord="minute" score="0.727">minute</span>. But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span> that spoke particular <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="regard" newWord="family" score="0.953">family</span>. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">Course</span> occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>. On this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span> she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interpretation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.236" formerWord="interpretation" newWord="fragrance" score="0.236">fragrance</span>, denoted a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>recollection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.228" formerWord="recollection" newWord="delivery" score="0.228">delivery</span> of Jane not untinctured by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tenderness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.792" formerWord="tenderness" newWord="day" score="0.792">day</span>, and a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="wish" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span> of saying more that might lead to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.888" formerWord="mention" newWord="sister" score="0.888">sister</span> of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> when the others were talking together, and in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tone</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="tone" newWord="sister" score="0.943">sister</span> which had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.854">mind</span> of real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regret</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="regret" newWord="family" score="0.972">family</span>, that it"was a very long <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> since he had had the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> of seeing her;"and, before she could reply, he added,"It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dancing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="dancing" newWord="brother" score="0.962">brother</span> together at Netherfield."
<p>Elizabeth was pleased to find his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>memory</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.463" formerWord="memory" newWord="deficiency" score="0.463">deficiency</span> so exact; and he afterwards took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="occasion" newWord="family" score="0.986">family</span> to ask her, when unattended to by any of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="rest" newWord="nothing" score="0.984">nothing</span>, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.963" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.963">time</span>, nor in the preceding <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>remark</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.379" formerWord="remark" newWord="ridicule" score="0.379">ridicule</span>; but there was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>look</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.925" formerWord="look" newWord="nothing" score="0.925">nothing</span> and a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> which gave them meaning. 
<p>It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>glimpse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.584" formerWord="glimpse" newWord="absence" score="0.584">absence</span>, she saw an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>expression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="expression" newWord="woman" score="0.795">woman</span> of general <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>complaisance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.23" formerWord="complaisance" newWord="cart" score="0.23">cart</span>, and in all that he said she heard an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="accent" newWord="period" score="0.675">period</span> so removed from <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hauteur</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.406" formerWord="hauteur" newWord="communication" score="0.406">communication</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disdain</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.406" formerWord="disdain" newWord="park" score="0.406">park</span> of his companions, as convinced <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>her</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="her" newWord="affection" score="0.986">affection</span> that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>improvement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.886" formerWord="improvement" newWord="side" score="0.886">side</span> of manners which she had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>yesterday</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="yesterday" newWord="family" score="0.967">family</span> witnessed however temporary its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>existence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.587" formerWord="existence" newWord="countenance" score="0.587">countenance</span> might prove, had at least outlived <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>.

<p>Bingley expressed great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>certainty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.847" formerWord="certainty" newWord="family" score="0.847">family</span> of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.

<p>Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>method</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.298" formerWord="method" newWord="field" score="0.298">field</span> of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>look</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.925" formerWord="look" newWord="nothing" score="0.925">nothing</span> somewhat nettled, she had all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.888" formerWord="success" newWord="man" score="0.888">man</span> she expected.

<p>"Yes,"replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer,"but that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquaintance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="acquaintance" newWord="time" score="0.974">time</span>."

<p>Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.

<p>"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span>, as they drove from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>;"and really, upon serious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.913" formerWord="consideration" newWord="affection" score="0.913">affection</span>, I am much more inclined than I was to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.965" formerWord="judge" newWord="friend" score="0.965">friend</span> as your eldest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> does on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.971">affection</span>. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> should form such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.428" formerWord="design" newWord="wife" score="0.428">wife</span> against a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> who is by no means unprotected or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friendless</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.253" formerWord="friendless" newWord="gape" score="0.253">gape</span>, and who was actually staying in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>colonel</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.325" formerWord="colonel" newWord="midst" score="0.325">midst</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.93" formerWord="regiment" newWord="family" score="0.93">family</span>, after such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affront</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.638" formerWord="affront" newWord="person" score="0.638">person</span> to Colonel Forster? His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temptation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.386" formerWord="temptation" newWord="weakness" score="0.386">weakness</span> is not adequate to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>risk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.641" formerWord="risk" newWord="affair" score="0.641">affair</span>!"
<p>"Do you really think so?"cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span>. 
<p>"Upon my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span>,"said Mrs. Gardiner,"I begin to be of your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="opinion" newWord="nothing" score="0.977">nothing</span>.

I cannot think so very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ill</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="ill" newWord="son" score="0.951">son</span> of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"
<p>"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="interest" newWord="family" score="0.981">family</span>; but of every other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neglect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.463" formerWord="neglect" newWord="dance" score="0.463">dance</span> I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>?"
<p>"In the first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span>,"replied Mr. Gardiner,"there is no absolute <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proof</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.856" formerWord="proof" newWord="nothing" score="0.856">nothing</span> that they are not gone to Scotland."
<p>"Oh! but their removing from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chaise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.3" formerWord="chaise" newWord="met" score="0.3">met</span> into a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hackney</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.269" formerWord="hackney" newWord="imitation" score="0.269">imitation</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coach</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.874" formerWord="coach" newWord="anything" score="0.874">anything</span> is such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>presumption</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.73" formerWord="presumption" newWord="subject" score="0.73">subject</span>! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>road</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="road" newWord="deal" score="0.796">deal</span>."
<p>"Well, then - - supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="purpose" newWord="part" score="0.827">part</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>concealment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.365" formerWord="concealment" newWord="assertion" score="0.365">assertion</span>, for no more exceptional <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="purpose" newWord="part" score="0.827">part</span>. It is not likely that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="money" newWord="time" score="0.975">time</span> should be very abundant on either <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland."
<p>"But why all this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>secrecy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.447" formerWord="secrecy" newWord="fault" score="0.447">fault</span>? Why any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fear</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.832" formerWord="fear" newWord="family" score="0.832">family</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>detection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.394" formerWord="detection" newWord="abode" score="0.394">abode</span>? Why must their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> be private? Oh, no, no - - this is not likely. His most particular <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>, you see by Jane's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="account" newWord="family" score="0.992">family</span>, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.

He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia - - what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attraction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.623" formerWord="attraction" newWord="thing" score="0.623">thing</span> has she beyond <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>youth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.836" formerWord="youth" newWord="ball" score="0.836">ball</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>health</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="health" newWord="time" score="0.938">time</span>, and good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="humour" newWord="journey" score="0.922">journey</span> that could make him, for her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.79" formerWord="sake" newWord="company" score="0.79">company</span>, forego every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="chance" newWord="time" score="0.924">time</span> of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>restraint</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.786" formerWord="restraint" newWord="account" score="0.786">account</span> the apprehensions of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disgrace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="disgrace" newWord="time" score="0.857">time</span> in the corps might throw on a dishonourable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>elopement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.306" formerWord="elopement" newWord="barouche" score="0.306">barouche</span> with her, I am not able to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.965" formerWord="judge" newWord="friend" score="0.965">friend</span>; for I know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> of the effects that such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="step" newWord="round" score="0.725">round</span> might produce. But as to your other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>objection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.31" formerWord="objection" newWord="sentiment" score="0.31">sentiment</span>, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span>, from his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indolence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.497" formerWord="indolence" newWord="chief" score="0.497">chief</span> and the little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span> could do, in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.971">affection</span>."
<p>"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="everything" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> but love of him as to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="consent" newWord="brother" score="0.967">brother</span> to live with him on any terms other than <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>?"
<p>"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,"replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes,"that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="sense" newWord="man" score="0.978">man</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>decency</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.232" formerWord="decency" newWord="pin" score="0.232">pin</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>virtue</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="virtue" newWord="rest" score="0.814">rest</span> in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span> should admit of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="doubt" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span>. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>justice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="justice" newWord="family" score="0.959">family</span>. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>twelvemonth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.723" formerWord="twelvemonth" newWord="answer" score="0.723">answer</span> - - she has been given up to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> but <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amusement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.861" formerWord="amusement" newWord="way" score="0.861">way</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>vanity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="vanity" newWord="woman" score="0.922">woman</span>. She has been allowed to dispose of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> in the most idle and frivolous <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>, and to adopt any opinions that came in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>.

And we all know that Wickham has every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>charm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.891" formerWord="charm" newWord="sister" score="0.891">sister</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.943">time</span> and address that can captivate a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>."
<p>"But you see that Jane,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>,"does not think so very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ill</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="ill" newWord="son" score="0.951">son</span> of Wickham as to believe him capable of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attempt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="attempt" newWord="affection" score="0.967">affection</span>."
<p>"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?

But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.

<p>"And do you really know all this?"cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span> as to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mode</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.618" formerWord="mode" newWord="haste" score="0.618">haste</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="character" score="0.866">character</span> was all alive. 
<p>"I do indeed,"replied Elizabeth, colouring."I told you, the other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>, of his infamous <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> he spoke of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> who had behaved with such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>forbearance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.516" formerWord="forbearance" newWord="sort" score="0.516">sort</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>liberality</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="liberality" newWord="daughter" score="0.68">daughter</span> towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>liberty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="liberty" newWord="part" score="0.725">part</span> - - which it is not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>worth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="worth" newWord="man" score="0.953">man</span> while to relate; but his lies about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> Pemberley <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span>. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>unpretending</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.671" formerWord="unpretending" newWord="engagement" score="0.671">engagement</span> as we have found her."
<p>"But does Lydia know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> of this? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"
<p>"Oh, yes! - - that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.515" formerWord="relation" newWord="park" score="0.515">park</span> Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="truth" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span> myself. And when I returned <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>, the - - - - <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.339" formerWord="shire" newWord="distrust" score="0.339">distrust</span> was to leave Meryton in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="affection" score="0.961">affection</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>. As that was the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>, neither Jane, to whom I related the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span>, nor I, thought it necessary to make our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>knowledge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.872" formerWord="knowledge" newWord="pleasure" score="0.872">pleasure</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>public</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="public" newWord="housekeeper" score="0.508">housekeeper</span>; for of what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>use</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.506" formerWord="use" newWord="suffering" score="0.506">suffering</span> could it apparently be to any one, that the good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="opinion" newWord="nothing" score="0.977">nothing</span> which all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.672" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.672">duty</span> had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>necessity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="necessity" newWord="happiness" score="0.966">happiness</span> of opening her eyes to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> never occurred to me. That she could be in any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>danger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.945" formerWord="danger" newWord="family" score="0.945">family</span> from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deception</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.685" formerWord="deception" newWord="kindness" score="0.685">kindness</span> never entered my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>head</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.883" formerWord="head" newWord="occasion" score="0.883">occasion</span>. That such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consequence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="consequence" newWord="situation" score="0.903">situation</span> as this could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts."
<p>"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span>, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?"
<p>"Not the slightest. I can remember no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>symptom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.275" formerWord="symptom" newWord="shop" score="0.275">shop</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> on either <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>; and had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>corps</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.546" formerWord="corps" newWord="yesterday" score="0.546">yesterday</span>, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span>; and, consequently, after a moderate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>period</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="period" newWord="sister" score="0.944">sister</span> of extravagant and wild <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>admiration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="admiration" newWord="nothing" score="0.893">nothing</span>, her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fancy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.949" formerWord="fancy" newWord="family" score="0.949">family</span> for him gave <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, and others of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.93" formerWord="regiment" newWord="family" score="0.93">family</span>, who treated her with more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distinction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.535" formerWord="distinction" newWord="weather" score="0.535">weather</span>, again became her favourites."
