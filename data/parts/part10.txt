<p>"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>winter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.483" formerWord="winter" newWord="mind" score="0.483">mind</span> is over."

<p>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>commission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.679" formerWord="commission" newWord="talk" score="0.679">talk</span> before he left London, and he was to join his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.93" formerWord="regiment" newWord="family" score="0.93">family</span> at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="end" newWord="time" score="0.984">time</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="affection" score="0.961">affection</span>. 
<p>No <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>stay</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.788" formerWord="stay" newWord="point" score="0.788">point</span> would be so short; and she made the most of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> by visiting about with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span>, and having very frequent parties at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>circle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.774" formerWord="circle" newWord="home" score="0.774">home</span> was even more desirable to such as did <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>think</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.329" formerWord="think" newWord="matrimony" score="0.329">matrimony</span>, than such as did not. 
<p>Wickham's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her present <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="observation" newWord="minute" score="0.851">minute</span> to be satisfied, from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span> of things, that their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>elopement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.306" formerWord="elopement" newWord="barouche" score="0.306">barouche</span> had been brought on by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>strength</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.925" formerWord="strength" newWord="happiness" score="0.925">happiness</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span>, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>flight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.383" formerWord="flight" newWord="concerto" score="0.383">concerto</span> was rendered necessary by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="distress" newWord="friend" score="0.96">friend</span> of circumstances; and if that were the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>, he was not the young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> to resist an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of having a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>companion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="companion" newWord="affection" score="0.937">affection</span>. 
<p>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="occasion" newWord="family" score="0.986">family</span>; no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> was to be put in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>competition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.278" formerWord="competition" newWord="heaven" score="0.278">heaven</span> with him. He did every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> best in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span>; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>body</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.535" formerWord="body" newWord="dining" score="0.535">dining</span> else in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="country" newWord="family" score="0.987">family</span>. 
<p>One <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span>, soon after their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span>, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth: 
<p>"Lizzy, I never gave you an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="account" newWord="family" score="0.992">family</span> of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="wedding" newWord="brother" score="0.924">brother</span>, I believe. You were not by, when I told <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="mamma" newWord="friend" score="0.89">friend</span> and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"
<p>"No really,"replied Elizabeth;"I think there cannot be too little said on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>."
<p>"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement ' s, because Wickham's lodgings were in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>parish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.618" formerWord="parish" newWord="consent" score="0.618">consent</span>. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>church</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.488" formerWord="church" newWord="visit" score="0.488">visit</span>. Well, Monday <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span> came, and I was in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fuss</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.45" formerWord="fuss" newWord="minute" score="0.45">minute</span>! I was so afraid, you know, that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.854">mind</span> would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> I was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dressing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.403" formerWord="dressing" newWord="wait" score="0.403">wait</span>, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sermon</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.24" formerWord="sermon" newWord="groom" score="0.24">groom</span>. However, I did not hear above one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span> in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.518" formerWord="coat" newWord="chair" score="0.518">chair</span>."
<p>"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> were horrid unpleasant all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> I was with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>foot</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.552" formerWord="foot" newWord="park" score="0.552">park</span> out of doors, though I was there a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="affection" score="0.961">affection</span>. Not one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span>, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scheme</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="scheme" newWord="brother" score="0.976">brother</span>, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="carriage" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> came to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="door" newWord="time" score="0.979">time</span>, my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> was called away upon <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span> to that horrid <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="end" newWord="time" score="0.984">time</span> of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> was to give me away; and if we were beyond the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="hour" newWord="mile" score="0.678">mile</span>, we could not be married all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes ' <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, and then we all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>set</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.919" formerWord="set" newWord="idea" score="0.919">idea</span> out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="wedding" newWord="brother" score="0.924">brother</span> need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."
<p>"Mr. Darcy!"repeated Elizabeth, in utter <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amazement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.755" formerWord="amazement" newWord="anger" score="0.755">anger</span>. 
<p>"Oh, yes! - - he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span> about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"
<p>"If it was to be secret,"said Jane,"say not another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>. You may depend upon my seeking no further."
<p>"Oh! certainly,"said Elizabeth, though <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>burning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.286" formerWord="burning" newWord="pleasanter" score="0.286">pleasanter</span> with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span>;"we will ask you no questions."
<p>"Thank you,"said Lydia,"for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."
<p>On such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>encouragement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="encouragement" newWord="brother" score="0.955">brother</span> to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>power</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.887" formerWord="power" newWord="nothing" score="0.887">nothing</span>, by running away. 
<p>But to live in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ignorance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.643" formerWord="ignorance" newWord="horror" score="0.643">horror</span> on such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span> was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>information</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="information" newWord="situation" score="0.86">situation</span>. Mr. Darcy had been at her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="wedding" newWord="brother" score="0.924">brother</span>. It was exactly a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scene</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="scene" newWord="affection" score="0.935">affection</span>, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temptation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.386" formerWord="temptation" newWord="weakness" score="0.386">weakness</span> to go. Conjectures as to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meaning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="meaning" newWord="day" score="0.795">day</span> of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brain</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.894" formerWord="brain" newWord="brother" score="0.894">brother</span>; but she was satisfied with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="none" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>. Those that best pleased her, as placing his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conduct</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="conduct" newWord="kind" score="0.943">kind</span> in the noblest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>light</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.303" formerWord="light" newWord="composure" score="0.303">composure</span>, seemed most improbable.

<p>"MY DEAR NIECE, 
<p>"I have just received your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, and shall devote this whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span> to answering it, as I foresee that a little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>writing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.631" formerWord="writing" newWord="cause" score="0.631">cause</span> will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>application</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="application" newWord="agreement" score="0.387">agreement</span>; I did not expect it from you. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impertinence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.244" formerWord="impertinence" newWord="deference" score="0.244">deference</span>. Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> is as much surprised as I am - - and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>belief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.219" formerWord="belief" newWord="foresight" score="0.219">foresight</span> of your being a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span> concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit. 
<p>"On the very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> of my coming <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> from Longbourn, your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> had a most unexpected <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.408" formerWord="visitor" newWord="attendance" score="0.408">attendance</span>. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span> was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> after ourselves, and came to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resolution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="resolution" newWord="evening" score="0.869">evening</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hunting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.423" formerWord="hunting" newWord="intermission" score="0.423">intermission</span> for them. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>motive</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="motive" newWord="brother" score="0.924">brother</span> professed was his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conviction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.963" formerWord="conviction" newWord="friend" score="0.963">friend</span> of its being owing to himself that Wickham's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>worthlessness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.226" formerWord="worthlessness" newWord="intent" score="0.226">intent</span> had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="pride" newWord="sister" score="0.973">sister</span>, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span>. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>duty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="duty" newWord="time" score="0.98">time</span> to step forward, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>endeavour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.539" formerWord="endeavour" newWord="person" score="0.539">person</span> to remedy an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evil</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="evil" newWord="letter" score="0.962">letter</span> which had been brought on by himself. If he had another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>motive</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="motive" newWord="brother" score="0.924">brother</span>, I am sure it would never <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disgrace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="disgrace" newWord="time" score="0.857">time</span> him. He had been some days in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, before he was able to discover them; but he had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.854">mind</span> to direct his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>search</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.736" formerWord="search" newWord="part" score="0.736">part</span>, which was more than we had; and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consciousness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="consciousness" newWord="horror" score="0.796">horror</span> of this was another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span> for his resolving to follow us. 
<p>"There is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.794">husband</span>, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> ago <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>governess</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.252" formerWord="governess" newWord="animal" score="0.252">animal</span> to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>charge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.237" formerWord="charge" newWord="mercy" score="0.237">mercy</span> on some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.921" formerWord="cause" newWord="affection" score="0.921">affection</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disapprobation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.265" formerWord="disapprobation" newWord="volume" score="0.265">volume</span>, though he did not say what. She then took a large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span> in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="character" score="0.866">character</span> of him as soon as he got to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trust</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="trust" newWord="man" score="0.916">man</span>, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> in London, and had she been able to receive them into her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span>, they would have taken up their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>abode</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.819" formerWord="abode" newWord="minute" score="0.819">minute</span> with her. At <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>length</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="length" newWord="everything" score="0.967">everything</span>, however, our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> procured the wished-for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>direction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.821" formerWord="direction" newWord="friend" score="0.821">friend</span>. They were in - - - - <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>street</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="street" newWord="time" score="0.951">time</span>. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span> with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>return</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="return" newWord="brother" score="0.978">brother</span> to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assistance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.415" formerWord="assistance" newWord="barouche" score="0.415">barouche</span>, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="none" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> of her friends; she wanted no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>help</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.292" formerWord="help" newWord="duration" score="0.292">duration</span> of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, which, in his very first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.428" formerWord="design" newWord="wife" score="0.428">wife</span>. He confessed himself obliged to leave the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.93" formerWord="regiment" newWord="family" score="0.93">family</span>, on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="account" newWord="family" score="0.992">family</span> of some debts of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="honour" newWord="happiness" score="0.986">happiness</span>, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>flight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.383" formerWord="flight" newWord="concerto" score="0.383">concerto</span> on her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>folly</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.537" formerWord="folly" newWord="walk" score="0.537">walk</span> alone. He meant to resign his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>commission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.679" formerWord="commission" newWord="talk" score="0.679">talk</span> immediately; and as to his future <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span>, he could <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conjecture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.283" formerWord="conjecture" newWord="wit" score="0.283">wit</span> very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> to live on. 
<p>"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.854">mind</span> for him, and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span> must have been benefited by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>. But he found, in reply to this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.963" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.963">time</span>, that Wickham still cherished the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hope</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="hope" newWord="day" score="0.972">day</span> of more effectually making his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> in some other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="country" newWord="family" score="0.987">family</span>. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proof</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.856" formerWord="proof" newWord="nothing" score="0.856">nothing</span> against the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temptation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.386" formerWord="temptation" newWord="weakness" score="0.386">weakness</span> of immediate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.7" formerWord="relief" newWord="expectation" score="0.7">expectation</span>. 
<p>"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span> wanted more than he could get; but at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>length</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="length" newWord="everything" score="0.967">everything</span> was reduced to be reasonable. 
<p>"Every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> being settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="step" newWord="round" score="0.725">round</span> was to make your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>street</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="street" newWord="time" score="0.951">time</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> before I came <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inquiry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.681" formerWord="inquiry" newWord="house" score="0.681">house</span>, that your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span> was still with him, but would quit <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span>. He did not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.965" formerWord="judge" newWord="friend" score="0.965">friend</span> your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span> to be a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.943">time</span> whom he could so properly consult as your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span>, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>departure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="departure" newWord="news" score="0.808">news</span> of the former. He did not leave his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="name" newWord="family" score="0.971">family</span>, and till the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> it was only known that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.911">marriage</span> had called on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span>. 
<p>"On Saturday he came again. Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span> was gone, your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>, and, as I said before, they had a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>talk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="talk" newWord="happiness" score="0.933">happiness</span> together. 
<p>"They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too.

But our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.408" formerWord="visitor" newWord="attendance" score="0.408">attendance</span> was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>obstinacy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.247" formerWord="obstinacy" newWord="shoulder" score="0.247">shoulder</span> is the real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>defect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.607" formerWord="defect" newWord="minute" score="0.607">minute</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span>, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">Course</span> was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> about it ), your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> would most readily have settled the whole. 
<p>"They battled it together for a long <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, which was more than either the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.911">marriage</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.794">husband</span> concerned in it deserved. But at last your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>use</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.506" formerWord="use" newWord="suffering" score="0.506">suffering</span> to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="niece" newWord="love" score="0.854">love</span>, was forced to put up with only having the probable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>credit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.819" formerWord="credit" newWord="love" score="0.819">love</span> of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span> gave him great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, because it required an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>explanation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.92" formerWord="explanation" newWord="mother" score="0.92">mother</span> that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.948" formerWord="praise" newWord="time" score="0.948">time</span> where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most. 
<p>"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>addition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.876" formerWord="addition" newWord="mother" score="0.876">mother</span> to her own settled upon her, and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>commission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.679" formerWord="commission" newWord="talk" score="0.679">talk</span> purchased. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span> why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="reserve" newWord="weather" score="0.387">weather</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="want" newWord="time" score="0.938">time</span> of proper <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.913" formerWord="consideration" newWord="affection" score="0.913">affection</span>, that Wickham's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="truth" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span> in this; though I doubt whether his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="reserve" newWord="weather" score="0.387">weather</span>, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.97" formerWord="anybody" newWord="way" score="0.97">way</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="reserve" newWord="weather" score="0.387">weather</span>, can be answerable for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>event</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.237" formerWord="event" newWord="gentlewoman" score="0.237">gentlewoman</span>.

<p>"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="wedding" newWord="brother" score="0.924">brother</span> took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span>, and all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="money" newWord="time" score="0.975">time</span> matters were then to receive the last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>finish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.263" formerWord="finish" newWord="huswife" score="0.263">huswife</span>.

He was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> last Wednesday, that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conduct</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="conduct" newWord="kind" score="0.943">kind</span> on coming <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> was exactly of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>piece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.755" formerWord="piece" newWord="longbourn" score="0.755">longbourn</span> with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pain</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="pain" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span>.

<p>"You certainly do,"she replied with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>;"but it does not follow that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interruption</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.304" formerWord="interruption" newWord="grove" score="0.304">grove</span> must be unwelcome."
<p>"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and now we are better."
<p>"True. Are the others coming out?"
<p>"I do not know.

<p>She replied in the affirmative. 
<p>"I almost envy you the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to Newcastle.

But of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span> she did not mention my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="name" newWord="family" score="0.971">family</span> to you."
<p>"Yes, she did."
<p>"And what did she say?"
<p>"That you were gone into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>army</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.29" formerWord="army" newWord="key" score="0.29">key</span>, and she was afraid had - - not turned out well.

<p>"Certainly,"he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:

We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there."
<p>"Perhaps preparing for his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> with Miss de Bourgh,"said Elizabeth."It must be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.854">mind</span> particular, to take him there at this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span>."
<p>"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had."
<p>"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Yes</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.884" formerWord="Yes" newWord="honour" score="0.884">Honour</span>; he introduced us to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>."
<p>"And do you like her?"
<p>"Very much."
<p>"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span> or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well."
<p>"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>age</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="age" newWord="affection" score="0.975">affection</span>."

<p>"I do not recollect that we did."

<p>"How should you have liked making sermons?"
<p>"Exceedingly well.

<p>"I did <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hear</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.401" formerWord="hear" newWord="injury" score="0.401">injury</span>, too, that there was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>present</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="present" newWord="brother" score="0.959">brother</span>; that you actually declared your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resolution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.869" formerWord="resolution" newWord="evening" score="0.869">evening</span> of never taking orders, and that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span> had been compromised accordingly."

<p>Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> Elizabeth, by introducing the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span> of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.

<p>"Write to me very often, my dear."

<p>Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.935">man</span> ' s. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

<p>"I often think,"said she,"that there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> so bad as parting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."

And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"
<p>"You may depend on it,"replied the other,"for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>night</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.946" formerWord="night" newWord="life" score="0.946">life</span>; I saw her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>passing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.414" formerWord="passing" newWord="shortness" score="0.414">shortness</span> by, and went out myself on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.827" formerWord="purpose" newWord="part" score="0.827">part</span> to know the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="truth" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span> of it; and she told me that it was certain true.

<p>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="name" newWord="family" score="0.971">family</span> to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said: 
<p>"I saw you look at me <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>to-day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.371" formerWord="to-day" newWord="music" score="0.371">music</span>, Lizzy, when my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> told us of the present <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>report</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.556" formerWord="report" newWord="intimacy" score="0.556">intimacy</span>; and I know I appeared distressed.

<p>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.379" formerWord="view" newWord="dirt" score="0.379">dirt</span> than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>probability</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.85" formerWord="probability" newWord="family" score="0.85">family</span> of his coming there with his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>permission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.268" formerWord="permission" newWord="newspaper" score="0.268">newspaper</span>, or being bold enough to come without it. 
<p>"Yet it is hard,"she sometimes thought,"that this poor <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> cannot come to a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span> which he has legally hired, without raising all this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speculation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.411" formerWord="speculation" newWord="exertion" score="0.411">exertion</span>!

They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them. 
<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span> which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>twelvemonth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.723" formerWord="twelvemonth" newWord="answer" score="0.723">answer</span> ago, was now brought forward again. 
<p>"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,"said Mrs. Bennet,"you will wait on him of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span>."
<p>"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span>, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.

<p>His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.935">man</span> represented to him how absolutely necessary such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.

<p>"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.

<p>Jane looked at Elizabeth with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>concern</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.862" formerWord="concern" newWord="sister" score="0.862">sister</span>. She knew but little of their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meeting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="meeting" newWord="family" score="0.937">family</span> in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>awkwardness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.264" formerWord="awkwardness" newWord="disturbance" score="0.264">disturbance</span> which must attend her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, in seeing him almost for the first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> after receiving his explanatory <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>.

<p>She sat intently at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>work</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="work" newWord="nothing" score="0.955">nothing</span>, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span> carried them to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>face</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.256" formerWord="face" newWord="reproach" score="0.256">reproach</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>servant</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.61" formerWord="servant" newWord="word" score="0.61">word</span> was approaching the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="door" newWord="time" score="0.979">time</span>. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ease</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="ease" newWord="friend" score="0.972">friend</span>, and with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>propriety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.837" formerWord="propriety" newWord="none" score="0.837">none</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> equally free from any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>symptom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.275" formerWord="symptom" newWord="shop" score="0.275">shop</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resentment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="resentment" newWord="papa" score="0.387">papa</span> or any unnecessary <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>complaisance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.23" formerWord="complaisance" newWord="cart" score="0.23">cart</span>. 
<p>Elizabeth said as little to either as <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>civility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="civility" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span> would allow, and sat down again to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>work</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="work" newWord="nothing" score="0.955">nothing</span>, with an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>eagerness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.863" formerWord="eagerness" newWord="nothing" score="0.863">nothing</span> which it did not often command.

He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.

<p>Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> owed to the latter the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>preservation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.245" formerWord="preservation" newWord="dose" score="0.245">dose</span> of her favourite <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span> from irremediable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>infamy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.421" formerWord="infamy" newWord="wonder" score="0.421">wonder</span>, was hurt and distressed to a most painful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>degree</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="degree" newWord="sister" score="0.982">sister</span> by a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distinction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.535" formerWord="distinction" newWord="weather" score="0.535">weather</span> so ill applied. 
<p>Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.963" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.963">time</span> which she could not answer without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.349" formerWord="confusion" newWord="curiosity" score="0.349">curiosity</span>, said scarcely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span>; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sound</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.727" formerWord="sound" newWord="object" score="0.727">object</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>voice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="voice" newWord="brother" score="0.984">brother</span>; and when occasionally, unable to resist the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impulse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.417" formerWord="impulse" newWord="necessity" score="0.417">necessity</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span>, she raised her eyes to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>face</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.256" formerWord="face" newWord="reproach" score="0.256">reproach</span>, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span> but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ground</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.276" formerWord="ground" newWord="slope" score="0.276">slope</span>.

She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so. 
<p>"Could I expect it to be otherwise!"said she."Yet why did he come?"
<p>She was in no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="humour" newWord="journey" score="0.922">journey</span> for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anyone</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.361" formerWord="anyone" newWord="minute" score="0.361">minute</span> but himself; and to him she had hardly <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>courage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.548" formerWord="courage" newWord="thought" score="0.548">thought</span> to speak. 
<p>She inquired after his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, but could do no more. 
<p>"It is a long <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,"said Mrs. Bennet. 
<p>He readily agreed to it. 
<p>"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say you meant to quit the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.

Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ' Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet, ' without there being a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>syllable</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.382" formerWord="syllable" newWord="chair" score="0.382">chair</span> said of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span>, or the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> where she lived, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>. It was my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span> Gardiner's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>drawing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.528" formerWord="drawing" newWord="water" score="0.528">water</span> up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span> of it. Did you see it?"
<p>Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell. 
<p>"It is a delightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>, to be sure, to have a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span> well married,"continued her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>,"but at the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.93" formerWord="regiment" newWord="family" score="0.93">family</span> is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the - - - - <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.339" formerWord="shire" newWord="distrust" score="0.339">distrust</span>, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."
<p>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>misery</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="misery" newWord="time" score="0.917">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shame</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.949" formerWord="shame" newWord="happiness" score="0.949">happiness</span>, that she could hardly keep her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>seat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.705" formerWord="seat" newWord="sort" score="0.705">sort</span>.

<p>When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>civility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="civility" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>.

<p>As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interruption</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.304" formerWord="interruption" newWord="grove" score="0.304">grove</span> on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> astonished and vexed her.

<p>She could settle it in no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> that gave her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>. 
<p>"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, when he was in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>; and why not to me?

<p>"Now,"said she,"that this first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meeting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="meeting" newWord="family" score="0.937">family</span> is over, I feel perfectly easy.

<p>"I think you are in very great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>danger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.945" formerWord="danger" newWord="family" score="0.945">family</span> of making him as much in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> with you as ever."

On entering the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="round" newWord="minute" score="0.875">minute</span>, and happened to smile: it was decided.

She knew how little such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span> would give <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to either, or make either appear to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.579" formerWord="advantage" newWord="minute" score="0.579">minute</span>.

<p>She was in hopes that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> would afford some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of bringing them together; that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span> would not pass away without enabling them to enter into <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.854">mind</span> more of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> than the mere ceremonious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>salutation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.312" formerWord="salutation" newWord="service" score="0.312">service</span> attending his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>entrance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.915" formerWord="entrance" newWord="week" score="0.915">week</span>.

<p>"If he does not come to me, then,"said she,"I shall give him up for ever."
<p>The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="round" newWord="minute" score="0.875">minute</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.547" formerWord="table" newWord="morning" score="0.547">morning</span>, where Miss Bennet was making <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.908" formerWord="tea" newWord="time" score="0.908">time</span>, and Elizabeth pouring out the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coffee</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.345" formerWord="coffee" newWord="hurry" score="0.345">hurry</span>, in so close a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confederacy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.226" formerWord="confederacy" newWord="sedateness" score="0.226">sedateness</span> that there was not a single <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>vacancy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.258" formerWord="vacancy" newWord="profligacy" score="0.258">profligacy</span> near her which would admit of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="chair" newWord="haste" score="0.793">haste</span>. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whisper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.409" formerWord="whisper" newWord="furniture" score="0.409">furniture</span>: 
<p>"The men shan't come and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> us, I am determined.

<p>Darcy had walked away to another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>. She followed him with her eyes, envied <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everyone</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.393" formerWord="everyone" newWord="value" score="0.393">value</span> to whom he spoke, had scarcely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>patience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="patience" newWord="aunt" score="0.938">aunt</span> enough to help <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.97" formerWord="anybody" newWord="way" score="0.97">way</span> to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coffee</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.345" formerWord="coffee" newWord="hurry" score="0.345">hurry</span>; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! 
<p>"A <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> who has once been refused!

<p>She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coffee</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.345" formerWord="coffee" newWord="hurry" score="0.345">hurry</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cup</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.23" formerWord="cup" newWord="hymen" score="0.23">hymen</span> himself; and she seized the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of saying: 
<p>"Is your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> at Pemberley still?"
<p>"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."
<p>"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"
<p>"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."
<p>She could think of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.888" formerWord="success" newWord="man" score="0.888">man</span>. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span>; and, at last, on the young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.794">husband</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whispering</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.569" formerWord="whispering" newWord="week" score="0.569">week</span> to Elizabeth again, he walked away. 
<p>When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>'s rapacity for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whist</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.476" formerWord="whist" newWord="judgment" score="0.476">judgment</span> players, and in a few moments after seated with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="rest" newWord="nothing" score="0.984">nothing</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span>. She now lost every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>expectation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="expectation" newWord="time" score="0.975">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>. They were confined for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> at different tables, and she had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself. 
<p>Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>supper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.409" formerWord="supper" newWord="wonder" score="0.409">wonder</span>; but their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="carriage" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of detaining them. 
<p>"Well girls,"said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,"What say you to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>? I think every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dinner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="dinner" newWord="family" score="0.981">family</span> was as well dressed as any I ever saw.

The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>soup</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.458" formerWord="soup" newWord="cause" score="0.458">cause</span> was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases ' last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span>; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="beauty" newWord="family" score="0.976">family</span>. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? ' Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last. ' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>creature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.779" formerWord="creature" newWord="man" score="0.779">man</span> as ever lived - - and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."
<p>Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.579" formerWord="advantage" newWord="minute" score="0.579">minute</span> to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, when in a happy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="humour" newWord="journey" score="0.922">journey</span>, were so far beyond <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span>, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>, to make his proposals. 
<p>"It has been a very agreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>,"said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth."The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span> seemed so well selected, so suitable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> with the other. I hope we may often meet again."
<p>Elizabeth smiled. 
<p>"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> as an agreeable and sensible young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, without having a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="wish" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span> beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.428" formerWord="design" newWord="wife" score="0.428">wife</span> of engaging my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>. It is only that he is blessed with greater <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sweetness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="sweetness" newWord="minute" score="0.803">minute</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>address</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.731" formerWord="address" newWord="justice" score="0.731">justice</span>, and a stronger <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="desire" newWord="kindness" score="0.857">kindness</span> of generally pleasing, than any other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>."
<p>"You are very cruel,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>,"you will not let me <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>, and are provoking me to it every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span>."
<p>"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"
<p>"And how impossible in others!"
<p>"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"
<p>"That is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.963" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.963">time</span> which I hardly know how to answer.

<p>A few days after this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span>, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> had left him that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span> for London, but was to return <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> in ten days <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>. He sat with them above an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="hour" newWord="mile" score="0.678">mile</span>, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>concern</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.862" formerWord="concern" newWord="sister" score="0.862">sister</span>, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere. 
<p>"Next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> you call,"said she,"I hope we shall be more lucky."

<p>"We will be down as soon as we can,"said Jane;"but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.769" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.769">minute</span> an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="hour" newWord="mile" score="0.678">mile</span> ago."

<p>But when her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.
