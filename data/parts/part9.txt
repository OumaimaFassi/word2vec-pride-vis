<p>Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> in asking whether <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> had been heard of the fugitives.

<p>"And have you heard from him often?"
<p>"We have heard only twice.

<p>"And my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> - - how is she? How are you all?"

<p>"But you - - how are you?"cried Elizabeth."You look <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pale</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.229" formerWord="pale" newWord="evidence" score="0.229">evidence</span>. How much you must have gone through!"
<p>Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span>, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="end" newWord="time" score="0.984">time</span> to by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>approach</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.761" formerWord="approach" newWord="country" score="0.761">country</span> of the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span>.

<p>When they were all in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>drawing-room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.706" formerWord="drawing-room" newWord="room" score="0.706">room</span>, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span> repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="character" score="0.866">character</span> to give.

<p>They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> for her and all her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, told her that he meant to be in London the very next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>endeavour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.539" formerWord="endeavour" newWord="person" score="0.539">person</span> for recovering Lydia.

<p>"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"

<p>"But not before they went to Brighton?"
<p>"No, I believe not."
<p>"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does he know his real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span>?"
<p>"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.

<p>"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"
<p>"Perhaps it would have been better,"replied her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>."But to expose the former faults of any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.943">time</span> without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions."
<p>"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>note</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="note" newWord="day" score="0.96">day</span> to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.935">man</span>?"
<p>"He brought it with him for us to see."
<p>Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the contents:

Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.

<p>Mr. Gardiner added in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, that they might expect to see their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span> at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> on the following <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>, which was Saturday.

When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>satisfaction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.945" formerWord="satisfaction" newWord="affection" score="0.945">affection</span> as her children expected, considering what her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anxiety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.898" formerWord="anxiety" newWord="life" score="0.898">life</span> for his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>life</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="life" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> had been before.

Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"
<p>As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> that Mr. Bennet came from it.

<p>"You must not be too severe upon yourself,"replied Elizabeth.

<p>"And Lydia used to want to go to London,"added Kitty.

<p>"Is it possible?"cried Elizabeth, when she had finished."Can it be possible that he will marry her?"
<p>"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>."My dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span>, I congratulate you."

<p>"No; but it must be done soon."
<p>Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> before he wrote.

<p>"I dislike it very much,"he replied;"but it must be done."
<p>And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span>. 
<p>"And may I ask - -"said Elizabeth;"but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."
<p>"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."
<p>"And they must marry! Yet he is such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>!"
<p>"Yes, yes, they must marry.

<p>"That is very true,"said Elizabeth;"though it had not occurred to me before.

Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="idea" newWord="time" score="0.988">time</span> of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fun</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.609" formerWord="fun" newWord="behaviour" score="0.609">behaviour</span> if I was."

Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,"Oh! <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="mamma" newWord="friend" score="0.89">friend</span>, do the people hereabouts know I am married <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>to-day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.371" formerWord="to-day" newWord="music" score="0.371">music</span>? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curricle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="curricle" newWord="mother" score="0.893">mother</span>, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side-glass</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.225" formerWord="side-glass" newWord="taught" score="0.225">taught</span> next to him, and took off my glove, and let my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hand</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="hand" newWord="family" score="0.975">family</span> just <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="rest" newWord="nothing" score="0.984">nothing</span> upon the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>window</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.342" formerWord="window" newWord="agreeableness" score="0.342">agreeableness</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>frame</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.408" formerWord="frame" newWord="dirt" score="0.408">dirt</span>, so that he might see the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ring</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.599" formerWord="ring" newWord="justice" score="0.599">justice</span>, and then I bowed and smiled like <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>."
<p>Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hall</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.292" formerWord="hall" newWord="pelisse" score="0.292">pelisse</span> to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dining</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.788" formerWord="dining" newWord="minute" score="0.788">minute</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>parlour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.339" formerWord="parlour" newWord="distance" score="0.339">distance</span>. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>parade</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.389" formerWord="parade" newWord="certainty" score="0.389">certainty</span>, walk up to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>'s right <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hand</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="hand" newWord="family" score="0.975">family</span>, and hear her say to her eldest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>,"Ah!

<p>It was not to be supposed that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> would give Lydia that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>embarrassment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.367" formerWord="embarrassment" newWord="shortness" score="0.367">shortness</span> from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ease</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="ease" newWord="friend" score="0.972">friend</span> and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called"Mrs. Wickham"by each of them; and in the mean <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, she went after <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dinner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="dinner" newWord="family" score="0.981">family</span> to show her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ring</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.599" formerWord="ring" newWord="justice" score="0.599">justice</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>boast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.466" formerWord="boast" newWord="horror" score="0.466">horror</span> of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids. 
<p>"Well, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="mamma" newWord="friend" score="0.89">friend</span>,"said she, when they were all returned to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breakfast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.727" formerWord="breakfast" newWord="influence" score="0.727">influence</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.973">course</span>,"and what do you think of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>husband</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="husband" newWord="brother" score="0.981">brother</span>?

<p>"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> off. Must it be so?"
