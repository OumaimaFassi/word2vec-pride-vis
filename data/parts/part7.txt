<p>The two gentlemen left Rosings the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span>, and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> the pleasing <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="character" score="0.866">character</span>, of their appearing in very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>health</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="health" newWord="time" score="0.938">time</span>, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>melancholy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.918" formerWord="melancholy" newWord="heart" score="0.918">heart</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scene</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.935" formerWord="scene" newWord="affection" score="0.935">affection</span> so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span>; and on his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>return</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="return" newWord="brother" score="0.978">brother</span> brought back, with great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>satisfaction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.945" formerWord="satisfaction" newWord="affection" score="0.945">affection</span>, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>message</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.837" formerWord="message" newWord="worth" score="0.837">worth</span> from her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ladyship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.907" formerWord="ladyship" newWord="family" score="0.907">family</span>, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her. 
<p>Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> have been presented to her as her future <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="niece" newWord="love" score="0.854">love</span>; nor could she think, without a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>, of what her ladyship's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indignation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.908" formerWord="indignation" newWord="anything" score="0.908">anything</span> would have been."What would she have said? how would she have behaved?"were questions with which she amused herself. 
<p>Their first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span> was the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>diminution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.271" formerWord="diminution" newWord="self" score="0.271">self</span> of the Rosings <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span>."I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,"said Lady Catherine;"I believe no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> feels the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>loss</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.97" formerWord="loss" newWord="brother" score="0.97">brother</span> of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span>.

<p>Lady Catherine observed, after <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dinner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="dinner" newWord="family" score="0.981">family</span>, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accounting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.237" formerWord="accounting" newWord="avowal" score="0.237">avowal</span> for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> again so soon, she added:

<p>"But my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.951">aunt</span> cannot.

<p>To this Mary very gravely replied,"Far be it from me, my dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, to depreciate such pleasures!

<p>"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,"said she,"and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disappointment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="disappointment" newWord="time" score="0.947">time</span>!"
<p>"Indeed,"replied Elizabeth,"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="regard" newWord="family" score="0.953">family</span> for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"
<p>"Blame you! Oh, no."
<p>"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"
<p>"No - - I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."
<p>"But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>."
<p>She then spoke of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, repeating the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.

<p>It was some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, however, before a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span> could be extorted from Jane. 
<p>"I do not know when I have been more shocked,"said she."Wickham so very bad!

<p>"There certainly was some great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mismanagement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.241" formerWord="mismanagement" newWord="sufferer" score="0.241">sufferer</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>education</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.787" formerWord="education" newWord="hearing" score="0.787">hearing</span> of those two young men.

<p>"Lizzy, when you first read that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, I am sure you could not treat the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.971">affection</span> as you do now."
<p>"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy.
